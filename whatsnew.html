<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/">NGFB version 7.6.x</a></strong> provides a new 'Licenses' settings page to allow for future plugin extensions. Although most of the setting pages and features may not appear to have changed from v7.5.5, the underlying code - to support future plugin extensions - has undergone important revisions. The 'Network' multisite sub-menu has also been renamed 'Advanced', and provides a few more cache related options for Network sites / blogs.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.7</strong> fixes the HTML encoding found in WooCommerce short descriptions, and adds support for expansion of special inline variables in meta tag values -- the <code>%%post_id%%</code>, <code>%%request_url%%</code>, and <code>%%sharing_url%%</code> variables will be expanded if/when found in any meta tag value.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.8</strong> simplifies the Social Settings metabox, and includes a small fix to retain any excluded options from the Social Settings metabox as well.</p>
