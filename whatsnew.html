<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/">NGFB version 7.6</a></strong> provides a new 'Licenses' settings page to allow for future plugin extensions. Although most of the setting pages and features may not appear to have changed from v7.5.5, the underlying code - to support future plugin extensions - has undergone important revisions. The 'Network' multisite sub-menu has also been renamed 'Advanced', and provides a few more cache related options for Network sites / blogs.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.1</strong> fixes a static class reference in 'NgfbSharing' for PHP v5.2 and older.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.2</strong> fixed a condition that would prevent sharing button JavaScripts from being loaded on index pages without posts.</p>
