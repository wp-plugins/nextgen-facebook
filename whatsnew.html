<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/">NGFB version 7.6</a></strong> provides a new 'Licenses' settings page to allow for future plugin extensions. Although most of the setting pages and features may not appear to have changed from v7.5.5, the underlying code - to support future plugin extensions - has undergone important revisions. The 'Network' multisite sub-menu has also been renamed 'Advanced', and provides a few more cache related options for Network sites / blogs.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.1</strong> fixes a static class reference in 'NgfbSharing' for PHP v5.2 and older.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.2</strong> fixed a condition that would prevent sharing button JavaScripts from being loaded on index pages without posts.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.3</strong> includes small updates to the settings help texts.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.3.1</strong> includes a fix for empty / missing Polylang post language, and adds support for the new pll_get_post_language() function (Pro version).</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.3.2</strong> fixes user ID detection on author index webpages, and improves the "Version Information" side metabox (now with information on extension plugins as well).</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.3.3</strong> updates the minimum short URL value from 21 to 22, and allows for longer Tweet text when using Twitter's shortening service.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.4</strong> adds support for social sharing buttons in the WooCommerce product Short Description text (top, bottom, or both).</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.4.1</strong> includes some minor code refactoring, and changes to some warning messages and option titles.</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.4.2</strong> fixes the link rel attribute name (should be 'href', not 'content').</p>

<p><strong>Version 7.6.5</strong> adds the 'Enable Excerpt for Pages' and 'Enable Tags for Pages' options, support for HeadSpace2 SEO, and support for the wp_http_validate_url() function.</p>
