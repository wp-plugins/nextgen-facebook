Complete Social Sharing Package for Improved Publishing on Facebook, G+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Google Search Results.

== Description ==

**An essential plugin for *every* WordPress website.**

= Open Graph and SEO =

NGFB Open Graph+ adds [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) and (optionally) [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) HTML tags to the head section of webpages. These HTML tags are used by Google Search and most social websites, to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, keyword tags, images, videos, author profile, etc.). See [examples from Google Search, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and others](/plugins/nextgen-facebook/screenshots/).

NGFB Open Graph+ is a *complete* social sharing plugin that uses the existing content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags. It can also be used to extend and improve traditional SEO plugins like Yoast WordPress SEO, All-In-One SEO, SEO Ultimate, etc.

**Once installed and activated, NGFB Open Graph+ enhances your webpages immediately by adding Open Graph meta tags based on your content -- there's no need to configure any additional settings**.

= Images and Videos =

NGFB Open Graph+ detects and uses all images, associated or included in your webpage content, and embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and Wistia (including the preview image). NGFB Open Graph+ was specifically written to support albums, galleries and images from NextGEN Gallery, but it also works just as well with the built-in WordPress Media Library.

**The NextGEN Gallery plugin is not required to use all the features of this plugin**.

= Twitter Cards =

NGFB Open Graph+ also provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), and [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) Cards, including configurable image sizes for each.

= Social Buttons =

NGFB Open Graph+ comes with several multilingual social sharing buttons, that you can add above / below your content or excerpt, as a widget, shortcode, or even call as a function from your theme template(s). Each of the following social buttons can be enabled, configured, and styled individually:

* Facebook
* Google+
* LinkedIn
* Pinterest
* StumbleUpon 
* Tumblr (Links, Quotes, Images, Videos)
* Twitter (Summary, Large Image Summary, Photo, Gallery, and Player Cards)

= Best Performance =

NGFB Open Graph+ is fast and tuned for performance, and unlike most plugins, makes full use of all available caching techniques as well (persistent / non-persistent object caches and disk caching).

= Clean Uninstall =

Try the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin with complete confidence -- when uninstalled, NGFB Open Graph+ removes *all* traces of itself from the database. 

= Great Support =

NGFB Open Graph+ is being actively developed and supported. You can review the [FAQ](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/faq/) and [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) pages for additional setup information. If you have questions or suggestions, post them to the WordPress [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook).

= Developer Friendly =

NGFB Open Graph+ also offers a wide variety of filter hooks, functions, methods and constants to customize the output and behavior of the plugin (see the [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) and the included `constants.txt` file for a complete list).

= Pro Version =

The *Free* version is a complete, stable, well supported and feature rich plugin. The [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) adds [Twitter Card](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) support and enhanced customization features for *each individual Post and Page*. You can enable a file cache for social images and JavaScripts (to further improve the page load times), and if you use a CDN or dedicated server to handle static content, the Pro version also includes a URL rewriting feature.

Upgrading to the Pro version is simple and easy -- click on the "Purchase the Pro Version" button located on any NGFB Open Graph+ settings page, purchase the plugin through Paypal, then receive an email with your unique Transaction ID and update the plugin from within WordPress (like a regular plugin update).

== Installation ==

= Install Methods =

To install the *Free* version from WordPress.org, follow the *Automated Install* method described bellow.

If you have purchased the Pro version, an email will be sent to you with installation instructions and a unique Transaction ID.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. What is the difference between the Pro and <em>Free</em> versions? =

**A.** [The Pro version of NGFB Open Graph+](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) adds support for Twitter Cards, and allows you to customize the Open Graph title, description, image, number of images / videos included, and enable / disable social buttons *for each individual Post and Page*. You can also enable a file cache to save social sharing images and JavaScripts locally, and provide URLs to these cached files instead of the originals (improving the page load times in most cases). If you use a CDN or dedicated server to handle static content, the Pro version also includes a URL rewriting feature. 

The *Free* version is a complete, stable, optimized, well supported, and feature rich plugin. If you appreciate the work and effort I've put into this plugin, please [purchase the Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) as a way to help with the continued development and support of NGFB Open Graph+.

= Q. How do I install the Pro version? =

Updating to the Pro version is simple and easy -- click on the "Purchase the Pro Version" button on any NGFB Open Graph+ settings page. After purchasing the Pro version, an email will be sent to you with installation instructions and a unique Transaction ID. Enter your unique Transaction ID on the Advanced settings page, and after saving the changes, an update for NGFB Open Graph+ will appear on the WordPress Updates page. Update the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin from within WordPress, as you would any other plugin, to download and activate the new Pro version.

= Q. Can I use the Pro version on multiple websites? =

NGFB Open Graph+ Pro is [licensed for a Single Website](http://surniaulula.com/wp-content/plugins/nextgen-facebook/license/pro.txt), and each purchase is assigned a unique Transaction ID. You must purchase a new license for each additional website using the NGFB Open Graph+ Pro plugin. [Contact me by email](mailto:jsm@surniaulula.com) for volume discounts (in multiples of 5 licenses).

= Q. Why don't my Twitter Cards show on Twitter? =

Your website must be 'authorized' by Twitter for each type of Twitter Card. Please see the [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) for the validation process.

= Q. Why doesn't Facebook show the correct Open Graph image? =

**A.** The first time Facebook accesses your webpage, it will cache the image and text it finds. Facebook then prefers to use the cached information until it has expired. So, before you hit the Facebook send / share button for the first time, make sure you're satisfied with your Post or Page images and text. If you change your mind, *and your webpage has not been liked or shared yet*, you can use [Facebook's Open Graph debugging tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug) to refresh Facebook's cache. If your webpage has already been liked or shared on Facebook, then there's nothing you can do to change the title, descriptive text, or image that was used.

After publishing a new Post or Page, a 'Validation Tools' tab will appear in the 'Custom Post Settings' metabox. You can use these links to check the content that is extracted from your webpage by Facebook, Google, etc.

= Q. How can I see what Facebook sees? =

**A.** Facebook has an [Open Graph debugging tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug) where you can enter a URL and view a report of it's findings. Try it with your Posts, Pages, archive pages, author pages, search results, etc. to see how NGFB presents your content. If there are Open Graph warnings, read them carefully -- usually they explain that the information they *already have* for this webpage is in conflict with the Open Graph information now being presented. This might be just the published and modified times, or (if the webpage has already been liked or shared) the title and image Facebook has saved previously.

= Q. Why does Facebook play videos instead of linking them to my webpage? =

**A.** The NGFB Open Graph+ plugin generates information about the current webpage and its content - what social websites like Facebook do with that information is beyond our control. When Facebook is given information on videos, it embeds and plays them directly instead of linking the preview image (as an example) to the source website. There are two possible solutions:

1. Turn off video discovery completely by setting "Maximum Number of Videos" to "0" on the NGFB settings page.
1. Uncheck the `og:video`, `og:video:width`, `og:video:height`, and `og:video:type` meta tags. This will leave the video preview images, but exclude information on the videos themselves.

= Q. Why doesn't Facebook embed my videos from Wistia? =

Sharing URLs for Wistia videos are only available from a password protected Wistia API. You can find your Wistia API password from the Wistia Account Dashboard, under API Settings. You must define the `NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD` constant in your WordPress `wp-config.php` file with your API password. For example (replace the stars with your API password):

`
define('NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD', '****************************************');
`

After defining the `NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD` constant, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc. will be able to correctly include and play these videos.

= Q. What about Google Search and Google Plus? =

**A.** Google reads the Open Graph meta tags as well, along with other "structured data markup" on your webpage. You can see what Google picks up from your webpages by using it's [Rich Snippets Testing Tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets). Use the "Author Link URL" and "Publisher Link URL" options on the NGFB settings page to have Google associate author profiles with your search results.

= Q. Does LinkedIn read the Open Graph tags? =

**A.** According to LinkedIn's [Setting Display Tags for Shares](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/setting-display-tags-shares) information page, they use three of the Open Graph tags (title, description, and url).

= Q. The W3C Markup Validation Service says "there is no attribute '<em>property</em>'". =

**A.** The Facebook / Open Graph meta *property* attribute is not part of the HTML5 standard, so the [W3C Markup Validator](http://validator.w3.org/) is correct in throwing up an error. In practice though, this incorrect attribute is completely harmless -- social sites (Facebook, Google+, etc.) look for it and don't care if it's part of the standard or not. If you want to address the W3C validator error, you'll have to change the DOCTYPE of your website to XHTML+RDFa (an example follows). The DOCTYPE definition is usually located in the `header.php` file of your theme.

`
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd">
`

= Q. Why does the Facebook "Like" button flyout get clipped? =

**A.** This is a known issue with the JavaScript code Facebook uses. If the "Like" button is placed near the edge of an HTML element with the overflow property set to hidden, the flyout may be clipped or completely hidden when the button is clicked. This can be remedied by setting the overflow property to a value other than hidden, such as visible, scroll, or auto. For example:

<pre>
#page { overflow:visible; }
</pre>

There is also a known issue with Facebook's "Like" button flyout and the WP *Twenty Eleven* and *Twenty Twelve* based themes. Including the following CSS in your stylesheet should fix the problem:

`
.ngfb-buttons iframe { max-width:none; }
`

= Q. Why are there duplicate Facebook / Google fields on the user profile page? =

**A.** NGFB Open Graph+ adds a "Facebook URL" and "Google URL" field to the profile page. If you already have another plugin that adds these fields to the profile page (under different names), you can tell NGFB to use these other field names instead. You can also remove or change the description of these additional fields (changing "Google URL" to "Google Link" for example). See the "Rename or Add Profile URL Fields" section in the [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) tab for additional information.

= Q. How does NGFB find images to include in the Open Graph meta tags? =

**A.** The images used in the Open Graph meta property tags for Posts and Pages are chosen in this sequence:

1. A *featured* or *attached* image from NextGEN Gallery or the WordPress Media Library.
1. An image from the NextGEN Gallery *ImageBrowser* (in combination with an `&#91;nggalbum&#93;` or `&#91;nggallery&#93;` shortcode).
1. A *preview* image from a NextGEN Gallery `&#91;nggalbum&#93;` or `&#91;nggallery&#93;` shortcode.
1. Image(s) from expanded NextGEN Gallery `&#91;singlepic&#93;`, `&#91;nggallery&#93;` or `&#91;nggtags&#93;` shortcodes.
1. Image(s) from HTML `<img/>` tags in the Post or Page content text.
1. A default image defined in the NGFB plugin settings.

= Q. Why does NGFB ignore the &lt;img/&gt; HTML tags in my content? =

If one or more `<img/>` HTML tags is being ignored, it's probably because the **image width and height attributes are missing, or their values are less than the 'Image Size Name' you've chosen on the settings page**. NGFB will only use an image equal to, or larger than, the 'Image Size Name' you've chosen.

If you want to display smaller image thumbnails in your content (on index webpages, for example), and still have NGFB use the larger versions of those thumbnails, you can add a "share" attribute with a URL to the larger image. For example:

`
<img
    share="http://underwaterfocus.com/wp-content/gallery/cache/40_crop_200x200_20080514-152313-mevallee-2951.jpg"
    src="http://underwaterfocus.com/wp-content/gallery/2008-05-bonaire-na/thumbs/thumbs_20080514-152313-mevallee-2951.jpg"
    width="150" height="150" />
`

The order in which the attributes are listed is important -- place the "share" attribute before the "src" attribute to give it a higher priority. If you do not want (or cannot add) a "share" attribute to the `<img/>` HTML tag, and would like NGFB to share smaller image thumbnails, you can uncheck the 'Ignore Small Images' option on the plugin settings page. You can also disable the feature by using the following constant in your wp-config.php or template files (before the `wp_head()` function call).

`
define( 'NGFB_MIN_IMG_SIZE_DISABLE', true );
`

= Q. How can I share a single NextGEN Gallery image? =

**A.** You could create a Page with the `&#91;singlepic&#93;` shortcode, or select the "Show ImageBrowser" option in the Gallery settings. When using the "ImageBrowser" option, images will be displayed on their own, with a unique URL that can be shared (instead of layering an effect over the current browser window).

= Q. How can I exclude certain parts of the content text? =

**A.** By default, NGFB will use the excerpt for the Open Graph description value. If an excerpt isn't available, the content text will be used instead. If there are parts of your content text that you don't want NGFB to pickup, you can wrap those sections between `<!--ngfb-ignore-->` and `<!--/ngfb-ignore-->` comment tags.

If you have the Pro version, you may also contact me by email (simply reply to the email you received when purchasing the Pro version).

== Support for Wistia Videos ==

If you embed videos from Wistia in your content, and you would like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc. to embed and play them as well, you must define an `NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD` constant in your WordPress `wp-config.php` file. The sharing URLs for Wistia videos are only available from a password protected Wistia API. You can find your Wistia API password from the Wistia Account Dashboard, under API Settings. For example (replace the stars with your API password):

`
define('NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD', '****************************************');
`

== Twitter Cards ==

Your website must be 'authorized' by Twitter for each type of Twitter Card. NGFB Open Graph+ Pro supports the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), and [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) Cards. For each type card, you must submit a sample URL from your website to Twitter's validation tool:

1. Make sure the 'Enable Twitter Cards' option is checked on NGFB Open Graph+ Pro's General settings page.
1. Go to Twitter's [Card Validator](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator).
1. 'Cancel' the Card Catalog popup (these are just examples).
1. Choose the 'Validate &amp; Apply' tab.
1. Enter an example URL from your website for the Twitter Card you would like to get approved. The Twitter Card type depends on the webpage content (see following).
1. If the Twitter Card type has not been approved yet, you may click on the 'Request Approval' button.
1. Fill-in and submit the form.

NGFB Open Graph+ creates the Twitter Cards based on the content of your webpages.

* Player : An embedded video in the content from YouTube, Vimeo, or Wistia.
* Gallery Card : Provided by NextGEN Gallery shortcodes (*nggalbum*, *nggallery*, and *nggtags*).
* Photo Card : An Attachment or NextGEN Gallery ImageBrowser webpage.
* Large Image Summary Card : An image defined in the Post or Page Metabox, a Featured, Attached, or NextGEN Gallery *singlepic* shortcode image. 
* Summary : All other webpages.

An 'ngfb_tc' filter hook is also available to customize the Twitter Card meta tags.

== Shortcodes ==

You can add one or more social sharing buttons to your content by using the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode. **The "Enable Shortcode" option must be enabled on the NGFB settings page** (disabled by default).

`
&#91;ngfb buttons="facebook, gplus, linkedin, pinterest, stumbleupon, tumblr, twitter"&#93;
`

You may use several arguments:

* `buttons` : A list of buttons to include, as shown in the example above.
* `url` : A specific URL to share, instead of the current webpage or Post URL.
* `pid` : A picture ID to share for the Pinterest and Tumblr buttons. NextGEN Gallery picture IDs must be in the form of 'ngg-#' (for example: `pid="ngg-123"`).
* `photo` : A specific photo / image URL to share for the Pinterest and Tumblr buttons. The `photo` argument takes precedence over the `pid` argument.
* `css_class` : A CSS class name.
* `css_id` : A CSS id name.

Note that by default (like all other methods used to add NGFB social buttons), a *featured* or *attached* image must be present for the Pinterest button to show (unless the `pid` or `photo` argument is used).

== Stylesheets ==

= Social Buttons Style =

NGFB Open Graph+ uses several layers of classes to describe all its social buttons, and each button has it's own individual class name and id as well. You may add styling for social buttons to an existing stylesheet (from your theme, for example), or use the built-in stylesheet editor found on the Social Style settings page.

The default styles offer a fairly complete example of CSS styling for the NGFB social buttons. In the default Social Buttons Style section I've specified the width (and height) for each button's `<div>`. This takes a little more work to get right, but *pre-defining the height and width of each button helps the page rendering speed significantly*. The `.ngfb-buttons` class is included within one of four other classes: `.ngfb-content-buttons` and `.ngfb-excerpt-buttons` for buttons enabled on the Social Sharing settings page, `.ngfb-widget-buttons` for buttons enabled from the widget, and `.ngfb-shortcode-buttons` for buttons added using the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode.

= Hide Social Buttons =

You can also hide the social buttons (or pretty much any object) in a webpage or post by using `display:none` in your stylesheet. As an example, if you use the "Inspect Element" feature of Firefox (right-click on the object to inspect) -- or use "View Source" to see the webpage's HTML -- you should find your content wrapped in a `<div>` HTML tag similar to this one:

`
<div class="postid-123 post type-post status-publish format-standard 
	hentry category-test category-wordpress tag-css tag-html">
		The post content text...
</div>
`

You could use any of these class names to hide one or more NGFB social buttons enabled on the settings page. For example, the following stylesheet hides the social buttons on Post <em>123</em>, any page in category <em>Test</em>, and posts using the Aside and Status formats:

`
.post-123 .ngfb-buttons,
.category-test .ngfb-buttons,
.format-aside .ngfb-buttons,
.format-status .ngfb-buttons { display:none; }
`

[The Pro version of NGFB Open Graph+](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) includes customized settings for each Post and Page, which allows you to enable / disable social buttons for each particular Post and Page without the use of CSS.

== Performance Tuning ==

The code for NGFB is highly optimized -- the plugin will not load or execute code it does not have to. And unlike most plugins, NGFB Open Graph+ makes full use of all available caching techniques:

* Non-persistent ([WP Object Cache](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache)) object caching for rendered (filtered) Post and Page content.
* Persitent ([Transient API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API)) object caching for the Open Graph meta tags, social buttons widget, shortcodes and content social buttons.
* Using an optional file / disk based cache for javascript and images from social websites (Pro version).

You may consider the following option settings to fine-tune the plugin for optimal performance.

* If your website content does not have any embedded videos, or you prefer not to include information on embedded videos in your Open Graph meta property tags, you can set the "Maximum Number of Videos" to "0". This will prevent the plugin from searching your content text for embedded videos.

* If you generally have a *featured* image for your posts and pages, you may set the "Maximum Number of Images" to "1". This will prevent the plugin from searching your content for additional images (the *featured* image counts as "1" and the plugin will stop there).

* For posts and pages, if no excerpt text has been entered, the content text is used to define the Open Graph description meta property value. If you generally don't use excerpts, and your content does not rely on shortcodes or plugins to render its text, you may uncheck the "Apply Content Filters" option.

* If you don't use the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode, you can uncheck the "Enable Shortcode" option if it has been enabled (the default is unchecked).

* If your infrastructure can serve JavaScript and image files faster and more reliably than Facebook, Google+, etc., you can set the "File Cache Expiry" option in the Pro version to several hours (the default of "0" hours disables this option).

* If the featured image, excerpt (or content text), etc., is not generally revised after publishing, you can increase the "Object Cache Expiry" option from 60 seconds to several minutes.

== Advanced Usage ==

= Include Social Buttons from Template File(s) =

The `ngfb_get_social_buttons()` function can be used to include social buttons anywhere in your template files. As an example, the following PHP code includes the Facebook, Google+, and Twitter social buttons from within a loop, post, or page (the `$post->ID` must be available):

`
<?php if ( function_exists( 'ngfb_get_social_buttons' ) ) 
	echo ngfb_get_social_buttons( array( 'facebook', 'gplus', 'twitter' ) ); ?>
`

The social button names for the array can be "facebook", "gplus", "linkedin", "pinterest", "stumbleupon", "tumblr", and "twitter".

You can also use the `ngfb_get_social_buttons()` function *outside* of a loop, post, or page, but you will have to provide additional information to the function. Since the `$post` variable is not available outside of a loop (to get the permalink), at a minimum you will have to provide the webpage URL. Here's an example from a custom NextGEN Gallery template (plugins/nextgen-gallery/view/): 

`
if ( function_exists( 'ngfb_get_social_buttons' ) ) { 
	$url = empty( $_SERVER['HTTPS'] ) ? 'http://' : 'https://';
	$url .= $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"].$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];
	echo ngfb_get_social_buttons( array( 'pinterest', 'tumblr' ),
		array ( 'pid' => 'ngg-'.$image->pid, 'url' => $url, 'caption' => $image->caption ) );
}
`

This creates a Pinterest and Tumblr button to share a picture from a NextGEN Gallery, sets the URL to the current webpage address, and uses the picture's caption as well. All social buttons, besides Pinterest and Tumblr, only need the URL defined.

= Disable Open Graph Meta Tags =

You can exclude the Open Graph meta tags from being added to certain webpages. You must set the `NGFB_OPEN_GRAPH_DISABLE` constant to true in your theme's header.php before the `wp_head()` function. Here's an example that disables NGFB's meta tags for image search results (a custom 'meta' template is called to define the Open Graph tags):

`
global $nggSearch
if ( is_search() && $nggSearch->found_images ) {
	define( 'NGFB_OPEN_GRAPH_DISABLE', true );
	echo $nggSearch->return_result( 'meta' );
}
wp_head();
`

= Rename or Add Profile URL Fields =

By default, NGFB adds two new URL fields to the user profiles -- the Facebook URL with a field name of "facebook" and the Google+ URL with a field name of "gplus". This is in keeping with the standard field names I've observed. If you need to change the field names, or their description, you can define the NGFB_CONTACT_FIELDS constant in your wp-config.php file. The default value for NGFB_CONTACT_FIELDS is:

`
define( 'NGFB_CONTACT_FIELDS', 'facebook:Facebook URL,gplus:Google+ URL,twitter:Twitter @username' );
`

A comma separates the different fields, and a colon seperates each field name from it's descriptive text. You may redefine the existing fields, remove them by leaving an empty string, or add to the existing list.

If you already have another plugin that adds Facebook and Google+ fields to the profile page (under different names), you can define this variable with those names. For example, if another plugin uses a "gplus_link" field, you can define the NGFB_CONTACT_FIELDS as shown above, changing the "gplus" field name to "gplus_link". This way, it will avoid having duplicate fields on the profile page, and that field will appear in the NGFB settings page.

= NGFB Filter Hooks =

Several [filter hooks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter) are available within the [NGFB Open Graph+ Pro](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) plugin to manipulate text (title, description, content, etc.) and arrays (tags, open graph, etc.). For example, here is a filter I use on [UnderwaterFocus](http://underwaterfocus.com/) to remove the 'Wiki-' prefix from WordPress tags. The following code adds the `uwf_filter_ngfb_tags()` function to the 'ngfb_tags' filter. The function receives an array of tags, which it transforms and returns. Generally, custom code is added to the `functions.php` file of your (child) theme.

`
add_filter( 'ngfb_tags', 'uwf_filter_ngfb_tags', 10, 1 );

function uwf_filter_ngfb_tags( $tags = array() ) {
        foreach ( $tags as $num => $tag_name ) {
                $tag_name = preg_replace( "/^wiki-/", '', $tag_name );
                $tags[$num] = $tag_name;
        }
        return $tags;
}
`

Most filters in NGFB are called with a single argument -- using the WordPress example from http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter, the `$accepted_args` parameter is '1' for most filters (exceptions are noted).

`
<?php add_filter( $tag, $function_to_add, $priority, $accepted_args ); ?> 
`

The following list of NGFB filters receive and must return a single *text string*.

* ngfb_section : The section text string used in the article:section meta tag.
* ngfb_title : The title string used in the og:title meta tag. If the page contains multiple pages, the page numbers are included in the title text string.
* ngfb_description : The description string used in the og:description meta tag.
* ngfb_content : The filtered (shortcode resolved, etc.) or un-filtered (depending on settings) content of the Post or Page.
* ngfb_caption : The caption used by Tumblr, Pinterest, and Twitter sharing buttons.
* ngfb_quote : The quote text used by the Tumblr sharing button.

The following list of NGFB filters receive and must return a single *array*.

* ngfb_topics : An array of build-in Topics. The default list is from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Websites_by_topic.
* ngfb_tags : An array of WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tags (if applicable and allowed by settings) used in the article:tag meta tags.
* ngfb_wp_tags : An array of WordPress Post and Page tags used in the article:tag meta tags.
* ngfb_ngg_tags : An array of NextGEN Gallery image tags used in the article:tag meta tags.
* ngfb_og : A complete, multi-dimensional array of all Open Graph meta tags.
* ngfb_tc : A complete, multi-dimensional array of all Twitter Card meta tags.

As an example, here's a filter to add custom topics ("Name One" and "Name Two") to the built-in topics list.

`
add_filter( 'ngfb_topics', 'my_filter_ngfb_topics', 10, 1 );

function my_filter_ngfb_topics( $topics = array() ) {
	$topics[] = 'Name One';
	$topics[] = 'Name Two';
	return $topics;
}
`

The following filter receives *two arguments* -- an array and a text string, and must return an array.

* ngfb_shortcode : Filters the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode attributes, and any content between the opening and closing tags (example: `&#91;ngfb&#93;some content text&#91;/ngfb&#93;`). The filter function should return the attributes array.

`
add_filter( 'ngfb_shortcode', 'my_ngfb_shortcode_filter', 10, 2 );

function my_ngfb_shortcode_filter( $atts = array(), $content = null ) {
	/*
	 * manipulate / extract content here
	 */
	$atts['url'] = $content;	// use content text as sharing url
        return $atts;
}
`

= PHP Constants =

To address very specific needs, some PHP constants for NGFB may be defined in your `wp-config.php` or template files (generally before the `wp_head()` function call). The complete list of constants, and a description of their intended use, can be found in the `constants.txt` file located in the `wp-content/plugins/nextgen-facebook/` plugin folder.

        vertical-align:middle !important;
}
</pre>

* Fixed: Added missing 'none' option in the Default Author selection lists.

= Version 6.2.1 =

Work-around for WordPress Bug [#17916](http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17916):

Performance Improvements:

* Moved jQuery character counters, on the custom Post/Page settings, inline with input fields.

= Version 6.1 =

The older stylesheet in `wp-contents/uploads/ngfb-social-buttons.css` is no longer used. Styling for social sharing buttons is now managed completely from the new Social Style settings page. Each type of button (content, shortcode, widget, etc.) has its own styling section. If you have customized the default stylesheet, please transfer your changes to this new settings page. The reason for splitting up the stylesheet this way is to allow for 'Social Styling Presets' in future versions.

* Added a check for possible Open Graph / Twitter Card conflict with Yoast WordPress SEO and SEO Ultimate plugins.

* Added *complete* support for Twitter Cards in the Pro version, including Gallery, Player, Photo, Large Image Summary, and Summary Cards.
* Added 'Twitter @username' to the user's profile page (in addition to the existing 'Facebook URL' and 'Google+ URL' user profile fields).
* Added sanitation code for custom user profile field values (remove HTML, URLs must be URLs, etc.).
* Added licence files for the *Free* and Pro versions in the nextgen-facebook/licence/ sub-folder.
* Changed the 'Image Size Name' option to 'Image Dimensions' with width, height, and crop values. This avoids the use of third party plugins to manage image size names.
* Added a new 'ngfb_shortcode' filter (Pro version) to modify shortcode attributes based on a content string (see the [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) for information on shortcodes and filters).

= Version 5.3 =

* Fixed saving of custom Post and Page settings in the Pro version.
* Added the ability for the *Free* version to self-update to the Pro version, after entering a valid Transaction ID on the Advanced settings page. 

= Version 5.2.3 =

* Added a check for PHP's safe_mode and/or open_basedir before setting CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION (which is not compatible with these PHP options).
* Added a check for NGFB_CURL_DISABLE before using PHP's curl to shorten URLs for Twitter.
* Minor changes to the markdown class (used to parses the readme.txt) to avoid a 503 error reported by some people.

= Version 5.2.2 =

* Fixed caching method to return no data when URL has failed (instead of returning the error message).
* Improved caching method to ignore failed URLs for 300 seconds.
* Improved readme.txt parsing to use the (older) local copy, if the readme.txt from WordPress.org is not available.
* Added the NGFB_CURL_DISABLE, NGFB_CURL_PROXY, and NGFB_CURL_PROXYUSERPWD constants.
* Renamed the NGFB_USER_AGENT constant to NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT.
* Renamed the NGFB_PEM_FILE constant to NGFB_CURL_CAINFO.

= Version 5.2.1 =

* Fixed a small typo in the goo.gl URL shortening class.
* Removed a few unused functions in the third-party markdown class.
* Added file caching to Tumblr and StumbleUpon images on the Social Sharing settings page.

= Version 5.2 =

* Added a "Clear All Cache" button on the *Plugin Information* metabox.
* Added a "Check for Updates" button on the *Plugin Information* metabox in the Pro version.
* Added a daily schedule (as part of 'wp_scheduled_delete') to remove expired cached files and transient object cache items.
* The Pro version update check schedule is adjusted (if necessary) to match the desired frequency (every 12 hours).
* Optimized the library class requirements and class object creation for admin and non-admin webpages.

= Version 5.1.1 =

* Fixed the `uninstall()` method to read plugin options as a stand-alone method.
* Improved the plugin `activate()` method to terminate sooner (and hand-off to the `init_plugin()` method that follows it).
* Added a `deactivate()` method to remove the Pro version "update check" cronjob (if any) upon deactivation.
* Added an NGFB_WP_DEBUG constant to send status / debug messages to WP's debug log as well. Add `define('NGFB_WP_DEBUG', true);` to the `wp-config.php` file to enable.

= Version 5.1 =

* The social website configurations (on the "Social Sharing" settings page) have been moved into their own individual setting boxes. The new layout is quite slick -- the social website boxes can be moved, re-arranged, removed, etc., all within a two column layout.
* Added a "Preserve on Uninstall" option on the Advanced settings page (default is unchecked). Checking this option preserves NGFB Open Graph+ settings when uninstalling the plugin (useful when upgrading to [the Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/)).  
* Added static content rewriting options for CDNs on the Advanced Settings page. The new Rewrite Settings allow you to enter CDN URLs, choose folders to include / exclude, etc.
* Removed the "Use WP-WikiBox for Pages" and "WP-WikiBox Tag Prefix" options. Customized content and tags can now be managed by with the new 'ngfb_description' and 'ngfb_tags' filter hooks (among many others). See the [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) for more information on NGFB filter hooks.
* Fixed the missing Pinterest button in the widget, when using both the widget and content social sharing buttons (the widget would detect the featured image as a duplicate, and not include the Pinterest button).

= Version 5.0.1 =

* Added a check to verify that the cache directory/files is writable/readable, preempting a possible PHP write/read error.
* Improved the option sanitation method to re-create missing checkbox options (checkboxes are not submitted by HTML forms when un-checked). This should fix the problem where checked options could not be unchecked.

= Version 5.0 =

Complete code review with an improved object-oriented design and several new classes.

* Added the ability to include social sharing buttons in the excerpt as well.
* Added a new "Custom Post/Page Settings" metabox for each individual Post and Page (enabled by purchasing the Pro version).
* Added transient caching to the url shortening method (reducing the number of requests to goo.gl).
* Streamlined the image discovery methods to improve performance (methods check the Maximum Images limit more often).
* Removed support for the "Exclude Pages" plugin (in the past, social sharing buttons were not added to excluded pages) -- social sharing buttons can now be disabled for individual Posts and Pages on the new "Custom Post/Page Settings" options box.
* Complete over-haul of the (too long) settings page, breaking it up into several pages under the new "Open Graph" menu item.
* This new version also allows you to unlock some Pro features, giving you the option to fine-tune the Title, Description, Images, etc., on individual Pages and Posts. The standard version of NextGEN Facebook Open Graph remains a complete, mature and full-featured plugin -- if you would like to thank me for my efforts, please consider purchasing the Pro version. Thanks.
