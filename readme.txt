= Social and SEO =

NGFB Open Graph+ adds [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) HTML tags to the head section of webpages. These HTML tags are used by Google Search and most social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, keyword tags, images, videos, product, author profile, etc.). [See examples from Google Search, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and others](/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/screenshots/).

Watch more videos about NGFB Open Graph+ on [SurniaUlulaCom's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SurniaUlulaCom).

NGFB Open Graph+ is a *complete* social sharing solution that uses the existing content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags -- there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings, though many settings and options are also available. 

NGFB Open Graph+ is a stand-alone plugin, that can *also be used to improve and extend traditional SEO plugins* like [WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/), All-In-One SEO, SEO Ultimate, etc.

= Images and Videos =

NGFB Open Graph+ detects and uses all images, associated or included in your webpage content, embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and Wistia (including preview images). NGFB Open Graph+ was specifically written to support albums, galleries and images from [NextGEN Gallery v1.x and v2.x](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) (shortcodes, image tags, album/gallery preview images, etc.), but also works just as well with the built-in WordPress Media Library.

= Twitter Cards =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) also provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) Cards, including configurable image sizes for each card type.

= e-Commerce Products =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) recognizes [WooCommerce v1.x and v2.x](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) product pages, creating appropriate meta tags for [Facebook Products](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/payments/product/), [Twitter Product Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) and [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/). WooCommerce product galleries, stock status, extended attributes, category and tag pages, are all supported.

= Optional Social Buttons =

NGFB Open Graph+ also comes with several social sharing buttons, that you can optionally include above / below your content or excerpt, as a widget, shortcode, or even call as a function from your theme template(s). Each of the following social buttons can be enabled, configured, and styled individually:

* Facebook
* Google+
* LinkedIn
* Pinterest
* StumbleUpon 
* Tumblr (Links, Quotes, Images, Videos)
* Twitter (Summary, Large Image Summary, Photo, Gallery, Player and Product Cards)

The Facebook, Google+ and Twitter social buttons support *multiple languages*. A default language can be chosen in the NGFB Open Graph+ settings, and the [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) will attempt to match the social button language with the webpage language (WordPress locale).

= Best Performance =

**NGFB Open Graph+ is fast and tuned for performance**, and unlike most plugins, makes full use of all available caching techniques as well (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching).

= Clean Uninstall =

Try the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin with complete confidence -- when uninstalled, NGFB Open Graph+ removes *all* traces of itself from the database. 

= Great Support =

NGFB Open Graph+ is being actively developed and supported. You can review the [FAQ](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/faq/) and [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) pages for additional setup information. If you have questions or suggestions, post them to the WordPress [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook).

= Developer Friendly =

NGFB Open Graph+ also offers a wide variety of filter hooks, functions, methods and constants to customize the output and behavior of the plugin (see the [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) and the included `constants.txt` file for a complete list).

= Pro Version =

The *Free* version is a full-featured, stable and well supported plugin. The [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) builds on this solid base by adding support for [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) products, tighter integration with popular SEO plugins (for title and description values), enhanced customization features for *each individual Post and Page*, and dynamically changes the social button language to match the webpage. You can also enable a file cache for social images and JavaScripts (to further improve the page load times), and if you use a CDN or dedicated server to handle static content, the Pro version includes a URL rewriting feature (for encoded URLs that other plugins do not detect).

Upgrading to the Pro version is simple and easy -- click on the "Purchase the Pro Version" button located on any NGFB Open Graph+ settings page, purchase the plugin through Paypal, then receive an email with your Authentication ID, and update the plugin from within WordPress (like a regular plugin update).

== Installation ==

= Install Methods =

To install the *Free* version from WordPress.org, follow the *Automated Install* method described bellow.

If you have purchased the Pro version, an email will be sent to you with Authentication ID and installation instructions.

= Q1. What is the difference between the Pro and <em>Free</em> versions? =

[The Pro version of NGFB Open Graph+](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) adds support for [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) products, tighter integration with popular SEO plugins (for title and description values), dynamically changes the social button language to match the webpage, allows you to customize the Open Graph title, description, image, number of images / videos included, and enable / disable social buttons *for each individual Post and Page*. You can also enable a file cache to save social sharing images and JavaScripts locally, and provide URLs to these cached files instead of the originals (to further improve page load times). If you use a CDN or dedicated server to handle static content, the Pro version also includes a URL rewriting feature (for encoded URLs that other plugins do not detect). 

= Q2. How do I install the Pro version? =

Updating to the [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) is simple and easy -- click on the "Purchase the Pro Version" button on any NGFB Open Graph+ settings page. After your purchase, an email will be sent to you with an Authentication ID and installation instructions. Enter your Authentication ID on the Advanced settings page, and after saving the changes, an update for NGFB Open Graph+ will appear on the WordPress Updates page. Update the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin from within WordPress, as you would any other plugin, to download and activate the new Pro version.

= Q3. Can I use the Pro version on multiple websites? =

NGFB Open Graph+ Pro is [licensed for a Single Website](http://surniaulula.com/wp-content/plugins/nextgen-facebook/license/pro.txt), and each purchase is assigned a unique Authentication ID. You must purchase a new license for each additional website using the NGFB Open Graph+ Pro plugin. [Contact me by email](mailto:jsm@surniaulula.com) for volume discounts.

= Q4. Can I use other social sharing buttons than those of NGFB Open Graph+? =

Absolutely. NGFB Open Graph+'s primary function is to create Open Graph and related meta tags (Twitter Cards, SEO, etc.). Aside from Pinterest and Tumblr, social buttons only send a URL to the social websites. Those websites then connect *back* to the shared URL, read the meta tags, and show the results in a social sharing popup window. The Pinterest and Tumblr sharing buttons must send more information, such as captions, media type (image, video), post type, etc.

NGFB Open Graph+ creates accurate titles, descriptions, adds images, videos, etc. according to your content and preferences. If you decide to use different social sharing buttons, please make sure they only share a URL, and not the title, description, etc. 

= Q5. What features of NextGEN Gallery v1.x and v2.x are supported? =

NextGEN Open Graph+ was written specifically to support features of NextGEN Gallery v1.x and v2.x. These include the following:

* Image IDs from NextGEN Gallery for Custom and Default images in the plugin settings.
* Featured images from NextGEN Gallery v1.x (that have an image ID in the form of 'ngg-##').
* Gallery shortcodes (nggalbum, album, nggallery, nggtags) for the Open Graph and <em>Gallery</em> Twitter Card meta tags.
* SinglePic shortcode for the Open Graph and <em>Large Image Summary</em> Twitter Card meta tags.
* NextGEN Gallery ImageBrowser for the Open Graph and <em>Photo</em> Twitter Card meta tags.
* NextGEN Gallery v1.x URL query parameters (album, gallery, pageid, pid).
* NextGEN Gallery album and gallery preview images and descriptions.
* Image tags (keywords) from NextGEN Gallery.

= Q6. How does NGFB Open Graph+ find images for the Open Graph meta tags? =

The images used in the Open Graph meta tags for Posts and Pages are chosen in this sequence:

1. An image defined in the Post or Page Open Graph+ Custom Settings (Pro version).
1. [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) product gallery image(s) (Pro version).
1. A *featured* or *attached* image from [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) or the WordPress Media Library.
1. An image from the [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) *ImageBrowser* (in combination with an `&#91;nggalbum&#93;` or `&#91;nggallery&#93;` shortcode).
1. A *preview* image from a [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) `&#91;nggalbum&#93;` or `&#91;nggallery&#93;` shortcode.
1. Image(s) from expanded [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) `&#91;singlepic&#93;`, `&#91;nggallery&#93;`, `&#91;nggtags&#93;` or `&#91;ngg_images&#93;` shortcodes.
1. Image(s) from `<img/>` HTML tags in the Post or Page content text.
1. A default image defined in the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin settings.

= Q7. Why does the plugin ignore the &lt;img/&gt; HTML tags in my content? =

If one or more `<img/>` HTML tags is being ignored, it's probably because the **image width and height attributes are missing, or their values are less than the 'Image Size Name' you've chosen on the settings page**. NGFB will only use an image equal to, or larger than, the 'Image Size Name' you've chosen.

If you want to display smaller image thumbnails in your content (on index webpages, for example), and still have NGFB use the larger versions of those thumbnails, you can add a "share" attribute with a URL to the larger image. For example:

`
<img
    share="http://underwaterfocus.com/wp-content/gallery/cache/40_crop_200x200_20080514-152313-mevallee-2951.jpg"
    src="http://underwaterfocus.com/wp-content/gallery/2008-05-bonaire-na/thumbs/thumbs_20080514-152313-mevallee-2951.jpg"
    width="150" height="150" />
`

The order in which the attributes are listed is important -- place the "share" attribute before the "src" attribute to give it a higher priority. If you do not want (or cannot add) a "share" attribute to the `<img/>` HTML tag, and would like NGFB to share smaller image thumbnails, you can uncheck the 'Ignore Small Images' option on the plugin settings page. You can also disable the feature by using the following constant in your wp-config.php or template files (before the `wp_head()` function call).

`
define( 'NGFB_MIN_IMG_SIZE_DISABLE', true );
`

= Q8. How do I attach an image without showing it on the webpage? =

Aside from using featured images, `<img/>` HTML tags in the content, etc., NGFB Open Graph+ can also include *attached* images in the Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags. Attached images have a link to the Post or Page, but are not displayed by default (unless they are also included in the content). To attach an image to a Post or Page, go to the Media -&gt; Library and upload a new image, or use one that is already listed with '(Unattached)' under the 'Uploaded to' column, and click on its 'Attach' link.

= Q9. How can I share a single NextGEN Gallery image? =

You could create a Page with the `&#91;singlepic&#93;` shortcode, or select the "Show ImageBrowser" option in the Gallery settings. When using the "ImageBrowser" option, images will be displayed on their own, with a unique URL that can be shared (instead of layering an effect over the current browser window).

= Q10. How can I exclude certain parts of the content text? =

By default, NGFB will use the excerpt for the Open Graph description value. If an excerpt isn't available, the content text will be used instead. If there are parts of your content text that you don't want NGFB to pickup, you can wrap those sections between `<!--ngfb-ignore-->` and `<!--/ngfb-ignore-->` comment tags.

= Q11. Why don't my Twitter Cards show on Twitter? =

Your website must be 'authorized' by Twitter for each type of Twitter Card. Please see the [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) for the validation process.

= Q12. Why doesn't the Twitter count increase? =

Your website must allow the HEAD HTTP request. Some security plugins (like BulletProof Security, for example) disable HEAD requests, which prevents the Twitter counter from incrementing correctly. 

At the Linux shell prompt, you can use the following command to verify if your website allows HEAD requests. If the command returns '200 OK', then your website allows HEAD requests. Any other return code means the request was blocked or redirected. The second example shows a request that was blocked because of curl's default user agent identification string. Replace "http://surniaulula.com/" used in this example by the URL to your website.

`
$ curl -I -A "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0" http://surniaulula.com/ 2>&1 | egrep '^(HTTP|Location)'
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

$ curl -I http://surniaulula.com/ 2>&1 | egrep '^(HTTP|Location)'
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
`

= Q13. Why doesn't Facebook show the correct Open Graph image? =

The first time Facebook accesses your webpage, it will cache the image and text it finds. Facebook then prefers to use the cached information until it has expired. So, before you hit the Facebook send / share button for the first time, make sure you're satisfied with your Post or Page images and text. If you change your mind, *and your webpage has not been liked or shared yet*, you can use [Facebook's Open Graph debugging tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug) to refresh Facebook's cache. If your webpage has already been liked or shared on Facebook, then there's nothing you can do to change the title, descriptive text, or image that was used.

After publishing a new Post or Page, a 'Validation Tools' tab will appear in the 'Custom Post Settings' metabox. You can use these links to check the content that is extracted from your webpage by Facebook, Google, etc.

= Q14. How can I see what Facebook sees? =

Facebook has an [Open Graph debugging tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug) where you can enter a URL and view a report of it's findings. Try it with your Posts, Pages, archive pages, author pages, search results, etc. to see how NGFB Open Graph+ presents your content. If there are Open Graph warnings, read them carefully -- usually they explain that the information Facebook *already has* for this webpage is in conflict with the Open Graph information now being presented. This might be just the published and modified times, or (if the webpage has already been liked or shared) the title and image Facebook has saved previously.

When editing a *published* Post or Page, a direct link to the Facebook Debugger is also available in the Open Graph+ Custom Settings metabox, under the Validation Tools tab.

= Q15. Why does Facebook play videos instead of linking them to my webpage? =

The NGFB Open Graph+ plugin generates information about the current webpage and its content - what social websites like Facebook do with that information is beyond our control. When Facebook is given information on videos, it embeds and plays them directly instead of linking the preview image (as an example) to the source website. There are two possible solutions:

1. Turn off video discovery completely by setting "Maximum Number of Videos" to "0" on the NGFB settings page.
1. Uncheck the `og:video`, `og:video:width`, `og:video:height`, and `og:video:type` meta tags. This will leave the video preview images, but exclude information on the videos themselves.

= Q16. Why does the Facebook "Like" button flyout get clipped? =

This is a known issue with the JavaScript code Facebook uses. If the "Like" button is placed near the edge of an HTML element with the overflow property set to hidden, the flyout may be clipped or completely hidden when the button is clicked. This can be remedied by setting the overflow property to a value other than hidden, such as visible, scroll, or auto. For example:

<pre>
#page { overflow:visible; }
</pre>

There is also a known issue with Facebook's "Like" button flyout and the WP *Twenty Eleven* and *Twenty Twelve* based themes. Including the following CSS in your stylesheet should fix the problem:

`
.ngfb-buttons iframe { max-width:none; }
`

= Q17. Why doesn't Facebook embed my videos from Wistia? =

Sharing URLs for Wistia videos are only available from a password protected Wistia API. You can find your Wistia API password from the Wistia Account Dashboard, under API Settings. You must define the `NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD` constant in your WordPress `wp-config.php` file with your API password. For example (replace the stars with your API password):

`
define('NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD', '****************************************');
`

After defining the `NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD` constant, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc. will be able to correctly include and play these videos.

= Q18. What about Google Search and Google Plus? =

Google reads the Open Graph meta tags as well, along with other "structured data markup" on your webpage. You can see what Google picks up from your webpages by using it's [Rich Snippets Testing Tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets). Use the "Author Link URL" and "Publisher Link URL" options on the NGFB settings page to have Google associate author profiles with your search results.

= Q19. Does LinkedIn read the Open Graph tags? =

According to LinkedIn's [Setting Display Tags for Shares](https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/setting-display-tags-shares) information page, they use three of the Open Graph tags (title, description, and url).

= Q20. The W3C Markup Validation Service says "there is no attribute '<em>property</em>'". =

The Facebook / Open Graph meta *property* attribute is not part of the HTML5 standard, so the [W3C Markup Validator](http://validator.w3.org/) is correct in throwing up an error. In practice though, this incorrect attribute is completely harmless -- social sites (Facebook, Google+, etc.) look for it and don't care if it's part of the standard or not. If you want to address the W3C validator error, you'll have to change the DOCTYPE of your website to XHTML+RDFa (an example follows). The DOCTYPE definition is usually located in the `header.php` file of your theme.

`
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd">
`

= Q21. Why are there duplicate Facebook / Google fields on the user profile page? =

NGFB Open Graph+ adds a "Facebook URL" and "Google URL" field to the profile page. If you already have another plugin that adds these fields to the profile page (under different names), you can tell NGFB to use these other field names instead. You can also remove or change the description of these additional fields (changing "Google URL" to "Google Link" for example). See the "Rename or Add Profile URL Fields" section in the [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) tab for additional information.

== Debugging and Problem Solving ==

NGFB Open Graph+ follows the latest recommended WordPress coding practices, but on occasion, it may break *other* themes and/or plugins that do not.

= WordPress Content Filters =

WordPress allows plugins and themes to hook into various filters, which are then used by WordPress to expand shortcodes, etc. WordPress generally calls a filter (like 'the_content') once to expand text for the webpage. As a consequence, some authors mistakenly assume that a filter they have created will only be executed once. WordPress filters are available to any theme and/or plugin that needs to expand text (title, excerpt, content, etc.), which NGFB Open Graph+ uses to provide a complete and accurate meta tag description (as an example).

On the Open Graph+ Advanced settings page, you can uncheck the 'Apply Content Filters' and 'Apply Excerpt Filters' to see if your problem is related to a WordPress filter hook. If unchecking these options fixes your problem, you should determine which filter is at fault and report the issue with the theme and/or plugin author. Using the WordPress `apply_filters()` function more than once should not break a theme and/or plugin.

If you have the Pro version, instead of disabling the use of content / excerpt filters, you can enter a custom 'Default Description' in the Custom Settings metabox, located on most Pages and Posts. NGFB Open Graph+ will then use the custom description instead of applying filters to generate a description from the content.

= Debug and Error Messages =

Turning on the WordPress debug log can be highly illuminating -- your theme templates and/or plugins may be generating many errors, which you would never see unless you turn on the WordPress debug log. To enable the WordPress debug log, without displaying the errors to your visitors, add the following to your `wp-config.php` file.

`
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
if ( defined('WP_DEBUG') && WP_DEBUG == true ) {
	define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
	define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
	@ini_set('display_errors',0);
}
`

NGFB Open Graph+ can also generate debug / activity messages by ckecking the 'Add Hidden Debug Info' on the Open Graph+ Advanced settings page. The debug mesages will be added directly to the webpage, as HTML comments, to allow debugging remotely. You can also define the following constant to enable the same behavior.

`
define('NGFB_DEBUG', true);
`

If you would like to send NGFB Open Graph+ debug messages to the WordPress log file instead (or as well), you can define the following constant.

`
define('NGFB_WP_DEBUG', true);
`

== Support for Wistia Videos ==

If you embed videos from Wistia in your content, and you would like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, etc. to embed and play them as well, you must define an `NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD` constant in your WordPress `wp-config.php` file. The sharing URLs for Wistia videos are only available from a password protected Wistia API. You can find your Wistia API password from the Wistia Account Dashboard, under API Settings. For example (replace the stars with your API password):

`
define('NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD', '****************************************');
`

== Twitter Cards ==

Your website must be 'authorized' by Twitter for each type of Twitter Card. NGFB Open Graph+ Pro supports the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), and [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) Cards. For each type card, you must submit a sample URL from your website to Twitter's validation tool:

1. Make sure the 'Enable Twitter Cards' option is checked on NGFB Open Graph+ Pro's General settings page.
1. Go to Twitter's [Card Validator](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator).
1. 'Cancel' the Card Catalog popup (these are just examples).
1. Choose the 'Validate &amp; Apply' tab.
1. Enter an example URL from your website for the Twitter Card you would like to get approved. The Twitter Card type depends on the webpage content (see following).
1. If the Twitter Card type has not been approved yet, you may click on the 'Request Approval' button.
1. Fill-in and submit the form.

NGFB Open Graph+ creates the Twitter Cards based on the content of your webpages.

* Player : An embedded video in the content from YouTube, Vimeo, or Wistia.
* Gallery Card : Provided by NextGEN Gallery shortcodes (*nggalbum*, *nggallery*, and *nggtags*).
* Photo Card : An Attachment or NextGEN Gallery ImageBrowser webpage.
* Large Image Summary Card : An image defined in the Post or Page Metabox, a Featured, Attached, or NextGEN Gallery *singlepic* shortcode image. 
* Summary : All other webpages.

An 'ngfb_tc' filter hook is also available to customize the Twitter Card meta tags.

== Shortcodes ==

You can add one or more social sharing buttons to your content by using the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode. **The "Enable Shortcode" option must be enabled on the NGFB settings page** (disabled by default).

`
&#91;ngfb buttons="facebook, gplus, linkedin, pinterest, stumbleupon, tumblr, twitter"&#93;
`

You may use several arguments:

* `buttons` : A list of buttons to include, as shown in the example above.
* `url` : A specific URL to share, instead of the current webpage or Post URL.
* `pid` : A picture ID to share for the Pinterest and Tumblr buttons. NextGEN Gallery picture IDs must be in the form of 'ngg-#' (for example: `pid="ngg-123"`).
* `photo` : A specific photo / image URL to share for the Pinterest and Tumblr buttons. The `photo` argument takes precedence over the `pid` argument.
* `css_class` : A CSS class name.
* `css_id` : A CSS id name.

Note that by default (like all other methods used to add NGFB social buttons), a *featured* or *attached* image must be present for the Pinterest button to show (unless the `pid` or `photo` argument is used).

== Stylesheets ==

= Social Buttons Style =

NGFB Open Graph+ uses several layers of classes to describe all its social buttons, and each button has it's own individual class name and id as well. You may add styling for social buttons to an existing stylesheet (from your theme, for example), or use the built-in stylesheet editor found on the Social Style settings page.

The default styles offer a fairly complete example of CSS styling for the NGFB social buttons. In the default Social Buttons Style section I've specified the width (and height) for each button's `<div>`. This takes a little more work to get right, but *pre-defining the height and width of each button helps the page rendering speed significantly*. The `.ngfb-buttons` class is included within one of four other classes: `.ngfb-content-buttons` and `.ngfb-excerpt-buttons` for buttons enabled on the Social Sharing settings page, `.ngfb-widget-buttons` for buttons enabled from the widget, and `.ngfb-shortcode-buttons` for buttons added using the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode.

= Hide Social Buttons =

You can also hide the social buttons (or pretty much any object) in a webpage or post by using `display:none` in your stylesheet. As an example, if you use the "Inspect Element" feature of Firefox (right-click on the object to inspect) -- or use "View Source" to see the webpage's HTML -- you should find your content wrapped in a `<div>` HTML tag similar to this one:

`
<div class="postid-123 post type-post status-publish format-standard 
	hentry category-test category-wordpress tag-css tag-html">
		The post content text...
</div>
`

You could use any of these class names to hide one or more NGFB social buttons enabled on the settings page. For example, the following stylesheet hides the social buttons on Post <em>123</em>, any page in category <em>Test</em>, and posts using the Aside and Status formats:

`
.post-123 .ngfb-buttons,
.category-test .ngfb-buttons,
.format-aside .ngfb-buttons,
.format-status .ngfb-buttons { display:none; }
`

[The Pro version of NGFB Open Graph+](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) includes customized settings for each Post and Page, which allows you to enable / disable social buttons for each particular Post and Page without the use of CSS.

== Performance Tuning ==

The code for NGFB is highly optimized -- the plugin will not load or execute code it does not have to. And unlike most plugins, NGFB Open Graph+ makes full use of all available caching techniques:

* Non-persistent ([WP Object Cache](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache)) object caching for rendered (filtered) Post and Page content.
* Persitent ([Transient API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API)) object caching for the Open Graph meta tags, social buttons widget, shortcodes and content social buttons.
* Using an optional file / disk based cache for javascript and images from social websites (Pro version).

You may consider the following option settings to fine-tune the plugin for optimal performance.

* If your website content does not have any embedded videos, or you prefer not to include information on embedded videos in your Open Graph meta property tags, you can set the "Maximum Number of Videos" to "0". This will prevent the plugin from searching your content text for embedded videos.

* If you generally have a *featured* image for your posts and pages, you may set the "Maximum Number of Images" to "1". This will prevent the plugin from searching your content for additional images (the *featured* image counts as "1" and the plugin will stop there).

* For posts and pages, if no excerpt text has been entered, the content text is used to define the Open Graph description meta property value. If you generally don't use excerpts, and your content does not rely on shortcodes or plugins to render its text, you may uncheck the "Apply Content Filters" option.

* If you don't use the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode, you can uncheck the "Enable Shortcode" option if it has been enabled (the default is unchecked).

* If your infrastructure can serve JavaScript and image files faster and more reliably than Facebook, Google+, etc., you can set the "File Cache Expiry" option in the Pro version to several hours (the default of "0" hours disables this option).

* If the featured image, excerpt (or content text), etc., is not generally revised after publishing, you can increase the "Object Cache Expiry" option from 60 seconds to several minutes.

== Advanced Usage ==

= Include Social Buttons from Template File(s) =

The `ngfb_get_social_buttons()` function can be used to include social buttons anywhere in your template files. As an example, the following PHP code includes the Facebook, Google+, and Twitter social buttons from within a loop, post, or page (the `$post->ID` must be available):

`
<?php if ( function_exists( 'ngfb_get_social_buttons' ) ) 
	echo ngfb_get_social_buttons( array( 'facebook', 'gplus', 'twitter' ) ); ?>
`

The social button names for the array can be "facebook", "gplus", "linkedin", "pinterest", "stumbleupon", "tumblr", and "twitter".

You can also use the `ngfb_get_social_buttons()` function *outside* of a loop, post, or page, but you will have to provide additional information to the function. Since the `$post` variable is not available outside of a loop (to get the permalink), at a minimum you will have to provide the webpage URL. Here's an example from a custom NextGEN Gallery template (plugins/nextgen-gallery/view/): 

`
if ( function_exists( 'ngfb_get_social_buttons' ) ) { 
	$url = empty( $_SERVER['HTTPS'] ) ? 'http://' : 'https://';
	$url .= $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"].$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];
	echo ngfb_get_social_buttons( array( 'pinterest', 'tumblr' ),
		array ( 'pid' => 'ngg-'.$image->pid, 'url' => $url, 'caption' => $image->caption ) );
}
`

This creates a Pinterest and Tumblr button to share a picture from a NextGEN Gallery, sets the URL to the current webpage address, and uses the picture's caption as well. All social buttons, besides Pinterest and Tumblr, only need the URL defined.

= Disable Open Graph Meta Tags =

You can exclude the Open Graph meta tags from being added to certain webpages. You must set the `NGFB_OPEN_GRAPH_DISABLE` constant to true in your theme's header.php before the `wp_head()` function. Here's an example that disables NGFB's meta tags for image search results (a custom 'meta' template is called to define the Open Graph tags):

`
global $nggSearch
if ( is_search() && $nggSearch->found_images ) {
	define( 'NGFB_OPEN_GRAPH_DISABLE', true );
	echo $nggSearch->return_result( 'meta' );
}
wp_head();
`

= Rename or Add Profile URL Fields =

By default, NGFB adds two new URL fields to the user profiles -- the Facebook URL with a field name of "facebook" and the Google+ URL with a field name of "gplus". This is in keeping with the standard field names I've observed. If you need to change the field names, or their description, you can define the NGFB_CONTACT_FIELDS constant in your wp-config.php file. The default value for NGFB_CONTACT_FIELDS is:

`
define( 'NGFB_CONTACT_FIELDS', 'facebook:Facebook URL,gplus:Google+ URL,twitter:Twitter @username' );
`

A comma separates the different fields, and a colon seperates each field name from it's descriptive text. You may redefine the existing fields, remove them by leaving an empty string, or add to the existing list.

If you already have another plugin that adds Facebook and Google+ fields to the profile page (under different names), you can define this variable with those names. For example, if another plugin uses a "gplus_link" field, you can define the NGFB_CONTACT_FIELDS as shown above, changing the "gplus" field name to "gplus_link". This way, it will avoid having duplicate fields on the profile page, and that field will appear in the NGFB settings page.

= NGFB Filter Hooks =

Several [filter hooks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter) are available within the [NGFB Open Graph+](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) plugin to manipulate text (title, description, content, etc.) and arrays (tags, open graph, etc.). For example, here is a filter I use on [UnderwaterFocus](http://underwaterfocus.com/) to remove the 'Wiki-' prefix from WordPress tags. The following code adds the `uwf_filter_ngfb_tags()` function to the 'ngfb_tags' filter. The function receives an array of tags, which it transforms and returns. Generally, custom code is added to the `functions.php` file of your (child) theme.

`
add_filter( 'ngfb_tags', 'filter_ngfb_tags', 10, 1 );

function filter_ngfb_tags( $tags = array() ) {
        foreach ( $tags as $num => $tag_name ) {
		$tag_name = preg_replace( '/^wiki-/i', '', $tag_name );
                $tags[$num] = $tag_name;
        }
        return $tags;
}
`

Most filters in NGFB are called with a single argument -- using the WordPress example from http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter, the `$accepted_args` parameter is '1' for most filters (exceptions are noted).

`
<?php add_filter( $tag, $function_to_add, $priority, $accepted_args ); ?> 
`

The following list of NGFB filters receive and must return a single *text string*.

* `ngfb_section` : The section text string used in the article:section meta tag.
* `ngfb_title` : The title string used in the og:title meta tag. If the page contains multiple pages, the page numbers are included in the title text string.
* `ngfb_description` : The description string used in the og:description meta tag.
* `ngfb_content` : The filtered (shortcode resolved, etc.) or un-filtered (depending on settings) content of the Post or Page.
* `ngfb_caption` : The caption used by Tumblr, Pinterest, and Twitter sharing buttons.
* `ngfb_quote` : The quote text used by the Tumblr sharing button.

The following list of NGFB filters receive and must return a single *array*.

* `ngfb_topics` : An array of build-in Topics. The default list is from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Websites_by_topic).
* `ngfb_tags` : An array of WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tags (if applicable and allowed by settings) used in the article:tag meta tags.
* `ngfb_wp_tags` : An array of WordPress Post and Page tags used in the article:tag meta tags.
* `ngfb_ngg_tags` : An array of NextGEN Gallery image tags used in the article:tag meta tags.
* `ngfb_og` : A complete, multi-dimensional array of all Open Graph meta tags.
* `ngfb_og_seed` : An empty array that will be used to build the Open Graph meta tags.
* `ngfb_og_woocommerce` : A complete, multi-dimensional array of all Open Graph meta tags for WooCommerce.
* `ngfb_tc` : A complete, multi-dimensional array of all Twitter Card meta tags.
* `ngfb_tc_seed` : An empty array that will be used to build the Twitter Card meta tags.
* `ngfb_tc_woocommerce` : A complete, multi-dimensional array of all Twitter Card meta tags for WooCommerce.

As an example, here's a filter to add custom topics ("Name One" and "Name Two") to the built-in topics list.

`
add_filter( 'ngfb_topics', 'my_filter_ngfb_topics', 10, 1 );

function my_filter_ngfb_topics( $topics = array() ) {
	$topics[] = 'Name One';
	$topics[] = 'Name Two';
	return $topics;
}
`

The following filter receives *two arguments* -- an array and a text string, and must return an array.

* `ngfb_shortcode` : Filters the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode attributes, and any content between the opening and closing tags (example: `&#91;ngfb&#93;some content text&#91;/ngfb&#93;`). The filter function should return the attributes array.

`
add_filter( 'ngfb_shortcode', 'my_ngfb_shortcode_filter', 10, 2 );

function my_ngfb_shortcode_filter( $atts = array(), $content = null ) {
	/*
	 * manipulate / extract content here
	 */
	$atts['url'] = $content;	// use the content text as the sharing url, for example
        return $atts;
}
`

= PHP Constants =

To address very specific needs, some PHP constants for NGFB may be defined in your `wp-config.php` or template files (generally before the `wp_head()` function call). The complete list of constants, and a description of their intended use, can be found in the `constants.txt` file located in the `wp-content/plugins/nextgen-facebook/` plugin folder.

* Added the following CSS to the 'Buttons Style' stylesheet for the Facebook "Share" button:

<pre>
div.fb-share-button { width:105px; }
div.fb-share-button span {
        display:block !important;
        vertical-align:middle !important;
}
</pre>
