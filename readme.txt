<blockquote>
<p><strong>Already have sharing buttons?</strong></p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WordPress Social Sharing Optimization</a> (WPSSO) plugin &mdash; a fork (aka child) of NextGEN Facebook (NGFB). They have the same author, many of the same excellent features, but <em>WPSSO is distributed without the sharing buttons and their related features</em>. As a result, WPSSO is 25% smaller and is often preferred for websites that already have (or don't need) a set of sharing buttons. Additional extension plugins are also available for WPSSO, including:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-am/">WPSSO App Meta</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-plm/">WPSSO Place and Location Meta</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-ssb/">WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons</a></li>
</ul></p>

= 3rd Party Integration =

Aside from the additional support for Twitter Cards, the main difference between the NGFB Free and Pro versions is the integration of 3rd party plugins and services.

**Images and Videos**

NGFB detects and uses all images - associated or included in your Post or Page content - including WordPress image galleries. WordPress Media Library images (and NextGEN Gallery in the Pro version) are resized according to their intended audience (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc). The Pro version also detects embedded videos from Slideshare, Vimeo, Wistia, and Youtube (including their preview images).

NGFB (Pro version) also includes support for [JetPack Photon](http://jetpack.me/support/photon/) and [NextGEN Gallery v1 and v2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).

**Enhanced SEO**

NGFB (Pro version) integrates with [WordPress SEO by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/), [All in One SEO Pack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/), and [HeadSpace2 SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/headspace2/) &mdash; making sure your custom SEO settings are reflected in the Open Graph, Rich Pin, and Twitter Card meta tags.

**eCommerce Products**

NGFB (Pro version) also supports [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/), [MarketPress - WordPress eCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-ecommerce/), [WooCommerce v1 and v2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), and [WP e-Commerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/) product pages, creating appropriate meta tags for [Facebook Products](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/payments/product/), [Twitter Product Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) and [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), including variations and additional / custom images.

**Forums and Social**

NGFB (Pro version) supports [bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) and [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) (see the [BuddyPress Integration Notes](http://surniaulula.com/codex/plugins/nextgen-facebook/notes/buddypress-integration/)), making sure your meta tags reflect the page content, including appropriate titles, descriptions, images, etc. Social sharing buttons can also be added to [bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single template pages and [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activities.

<img src="https://ps.w.org/nextgen-facebook/assets/screenshot-22.png?rev=" style="width:50%;min-width:300px;max-width:1024px;float:right;margin:0 0 20px 40px;" />
<h4>Social Sharing Buttons</h4>

NGFB comes with several sharing buttons, that you can optionally include on Post / Page editing pages, above / below your content or excerpt, [bbPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single pages, [BuddyPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activity entries, as a sidebar, widget, shortcode, or even call a function from your theme template(s). Each of the following sharing buttons can be enabled, configured, and styled individually:

* **Buffer**
* **Facebook** (Like, Send, and Share)
* **Google+**
* **LinkedIn**
* **ManageWP**
* **Pinterest**
* **Reddit**
* **StumbleUpon**
* **Tumblr** (Links, Quotes, Images, Videos)
* **Twitter** (Summary, Large Image Summary, Photo, Gallery, Player and Product Cards)

The Facebook, Google+ and Twitter sharing buttons support *multiple languages*. A default language can be chosen in the NGFB settings, and the [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) switches the sharing button language with the webpage language / WordPress locale. NGFB can also include hashtags from WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tag names in the Open Graph (Facebook) and Pinterest Rich Pin descriptions, Tweet text, and other social captions.

= User Profile Social Contacts =

NGFB (Pro version) allows you to customize the field names, label, and add / remove the following contacts from the user profile page:

* AIM
* Facebook URL
* Google+ URL
* Jabber / Google Talk
* LinkedIn URL
* Pinterest URL
* Skype Username
* Tumblr URL
* Twitter @username
* Yahoo IM
* YouTube Channel URL

<img src="https://ps.w.org/nextgen-facebook/assets/screenshot-23.png?rev=" style="width:50%;min-width:300px;max-width:1024px;float:right;margin:0 0 20px 40px;" />
<h4>Social Profiles for Google Search</h4>

NGFB provides <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/customize/social-profiles">author (Person) and publisher (Organization) social profiles markup in schema.org JSON-LD format for Google Search and their <em>Knowledge Graph</em></a>. The author (Person) markup includes the author's website URL, their profile social sharing image, and all listed contact URLs from their user profile. The publisher (Organization) markup includes the website URL, a corporate logo, a default image, and the publisher Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Twitter business pages.

= Complete Social Meta Tags =

NGFB adds [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) (Facebook), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and most social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, hashtags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). NGFB is a complete social sharing solution that uses the *existing* content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags &mdash; There's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings (although many settings and options *are* available). <a href="http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/screenshots/">See examples from Google Search, Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, etc.</a> &mdash; along with screenshots of the NGFB settings pages.

NGFB (Pro version) provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) Twitter Cards &mdash; *including configurable image sizes for each card type*.

= Proven Performance =

NGFB is *fast and coded for performance*, making full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching). NGFB loads only the library files and object classes it needs, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

= Clean Uninstall =

Try the NGFB plugin with complete confidence &mdash; when uninstalled, NGFB removes *all* traces of itself from the database (options, site options, user and post meta, transients, etc.).

= Great Support =

NGFB support and development is on-going. You can review the [FAQ](http://faq.ngfb.surniaulula.com/) and [Notes](http://notes.ngfb.surniaulula.com/) pages for additional setup information. If you have any suggestions or comments, post them to the [WordPress support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook) or the [Pro version support website](http://support.ngfb.surniaulula.com/).

== Changelog ==

<blockquote>
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). 
New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. 
When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released.
This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>
