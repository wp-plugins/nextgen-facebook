Improve the appearance and ranking of WordPress Posts, Pages, and eCommerce Products in Google Search and social website shares

== Description ==

**NGFB Open Graph+ adds HTML meta tags to the head section of WordPress webpages for improved Google Search results / ranking and sharing on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr and many more.**

= Summary of Features =

* Open Graph (Facebook, G+, LinkedIn, etc.), Rich Pins (Pinterest), and Twitter Card (Twitter) meta tags.
* Configurable image sizes and descriptions depending on context (various meta tags and social buttons).
* Integrates to 3rd party plugins and services for image, video, product, and content information:
  * NextGEN Gallery
  * JetPack Photon
  * WordPress SEO by Yoast
  * All in One SEO Pack
  * WooCommerce
  * MarketPress
  * WP e-Commerce
  * bbPress
  * BuddyPress
  * Youtube / Vimeo / Wistia APIs
* Optional social sharing buttons, both on front-end webpages and back-end admin editing pages.
* Configurable contact fields for user profile pages.

= Complete Meta Tags =

NGFB Open Graph+ adds [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) (Facebook), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and (optionally) [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and most social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, keyword tags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). [See a few examples from Google Search / Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and others](/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/screenshots/).

Watch more videos about NGFB Open Graph+ on [Surnia Ulula's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SurniaUlulaCom).

NGFB Open Graph+ is a complete social sharing solution that uses the existing content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags -- There's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings (although many settings and options *are* available).

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) Twitter Cards, including configurable image sizes for each card type.

= Best Performance =

**NGFB Open Graph+ is fast and tuned for performance**, and unlike most plugins, makes full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching).

**NGFB Open Graph+ only loads the library files and object classes it needs**, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

= 3rd Party Integration =

Aside from the additional support for Twitter Cards, the main difference between the GPL and Pro versions is the integration of 3rd party plugins and services.

**Images and Videos**

NGFB Open Graph+ detects and uses all images - associated or included in your Post or Page content - including WordPress Media Library image galleries and embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and Wistia (including their preview images). WordPress Media Library images (and NextGEN Gallery in the Pro version) are resized and provided according to their intended audience (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc). 

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) also includes support for [JetPack Photon](http://jetpack.me/support/photon/) and [NextGEN Gallery v1 and v2](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).

**Enhanced SEO**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) integrates with [WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [All in One SEO Pack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/), making sure your custom SEO settings are reflected in the Open Graph, Rich Pin, and Twitter Card meta tags.

**eCommerce Products**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) also supports [WooCommerce v1 and v2](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), [MarketPress WordPress eCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-ecommerce/) and [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/) product pages, creating appropriate meta tags for [Facebook Products](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/payments/product/), [Twitter Product Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) and [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), including poduct variations (size, color, etc.) and additional / custom images.

**Forums and Social**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) supports [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) and [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) (see the [BuddyPress Integration Notes](http://surniaulula.com/codex/plugins/nextgen-facebook/notes/buddypress-integration/)), making sure your meta tags reflect the page content, including appropriate titles, descriptions, images, etc. Social sharing buttons can also be added to [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single template pages and [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activities.

= Social Buttons =

NGFB Open Graph+ comes with several social sharing buttons, that you can optionally include on Post / Page editing pages, above / below your content or excerpt, [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single pages, [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activity entries, as a widget, shortcode, or even a function call from your theme template(s). Each of the following social buttons can be enabled, configured, and styled individually:

* Facebook Like, Send, Share
* Google+
* LinkedIn
* ManageWP.org
* Pinterest
* StumbleUpon 
* Tumblr (Links, Quotes, Images, Videos)
* Twitter (Summary, Large Image Summary, Photo, Gallery, Player and Product Cards)

The Facebook, Google+ and Twitter social buttons support *multiple languages*. A default language can be chosen in the NGFB Open Graph+ settings, and the [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) switches the social button language with the webpage language (WordPress locale). NGFB Open Graph+ can also include hashtags, from WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tag names, in the Open Graph (Facebook) and Pinterest Rich Pin descriptions, Tweet text, and other social captions.

= Custom Contacts =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) allows you to customize the field names, label, and show / remove the following Contact Methods from the user profile page:

* AIM
* Facebook 
* Google+ 
* Jabber / Google Talk
* LinkedIn 
* Pinterest 
* Skype 
* Tumblr 
* Twitter 
* Yahoo IM
* YouTube

= Clean Uninstall =

**Try the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin with complete confidence** - when uninstalled, NGFB Open Graph+ removes *all* traces of itself from the database (options, site options, user and post meta, transients, etc.).

= Great Support =

**NGFB Open Graph+ support and development is on-going**. You can review the [FAQ](http://faq.ngfb.surniaulula.com/) and [Notes](http://notes.ngfb.surniaulula.com/) pages for additional setup information. If you have any suggestions or comments, post them to the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook) or the [Pro version support website](http://support.ngfb.surniaulula.com/).

== Changelog ==

= Version 6.21.0 =

Please note that support for [the NextGEN Gallery plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) has been moved to [the Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) in v6.21.0. This restores balance between the two distributions - [the NGFB Open Graph+ GPL version from WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) offers complete support for Open Graph+ meta tags, the WordPress Media Library (including its `gallery` shortcode), and social sharing buttons, while the Pro version includes support for 3rd party plugins and services (like NextGEN Gallery, WordPress SEO, BuddyPress, bbPress, WooCommerce, Wistia videos, etc.). I remain committed to providing a complete and reliable set of features in the GPL version - all for free. There's no need to contribute in any way, though a little [help with forum questions](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook), for example, is always welcome. ;-)

* **Moved the NextGEN Gallery support to a Pro version addon**.
* Added support for **JetPack Photon** to retrieve correct image sizes (Pro version).
* Added an 'ngfb_image_downsize' hook (for the Jetpack Photon Pro addon).
* Added hooks to disable JetPack Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags.
* Added a hook for the 'ngfb_sharing_url' filter to support WordPress SEO's "Force Transport" option (Pro version).
* Moved the URL rewriting and shortening methods into hooks for the 'ngfb_rewrite_url' and 'ngfb_shorten_url' filters (Pro version).
* Moved the "Disable Social Buttons" option in the Open Graph+ Custom Settings from the 'Webpage Head' tab to the 'Social Sharing' tab.
* Added links to http URLs in the Open Graph+ Custom Settings 'Meta Tags Preview' tab.
* Changed the default object expiration time from 1800 to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
* Removed the "Reset Settings on Activate" Advanced option.
* Renamed the NGFB_RESET constant to NGFB_RESET_ON_ACTIVATE.
* Added an 'ngfb_load_lib' action to allow 3rd party plugins to provide library files.
* Moved several methods from lib/util.php to lib/com/util.php.
* Moved `show_sharing()` from lib/postmeta.php to lib/social.php.
* Renamed the 'NgfbPlugin' main plugin class to 'Ngfb'.

= Version 6.20.1 =

* Fixed a possible error condition in lib/media.php by adding an extra check, to make sure the size provided to the `image_constrain_size_for_editor()` filter is a string and not an array().

= Version 6.20.0 =

Version 6.20.0 centralizes much of the tooltip help text to make future translations easier. A bug in WooCommerce shortcodes has been found, and a work-around implented. An issue with the WordPress editor image size limits has been addressed as well - this version includes additional custom image sizes (ngfb-thumbnail/medium/large) that are not subject to the editor width limits.

* Fixed a WooCommerce bug, that redefined the $post variable when applying 'the_content' filter, by saving and restoring the $post variable.
* Added the WooCommerce query and shortcode classes when in admin interface to expand its shortcode for the Meta Tags Preview tab (Pro version).
* Added ngfb-thumbnail/medium/large custom image sizes, with identical values to those of WordPress, to bypass the `editor_max_image_size()` limits.
* Moved much of the tooltip help text into lib/messages.php to facilitate future translations.
* Removed the NGFB_OG_SIZE_NAME constant.

= Version 6.19.0 =

**There are several important changes in v6.19.0, including one that pushes some limits in the admin interface**.

You'll find a new 'Meta Tags Preview' tab in the Custom Settings metabox, available on the Post and Page editing pages. Since the core functionality of NGFB Open Graph+ is to create complete and accurate meta tags, I felt it was important to provide an easier / faster way to visualize them. By generating the meta tags on the admin / back-end, it's also now possible to warn of images that are too small (smaller than the plugin's configured settings). Two other notable changes are the added support for embedded YouTube Playlists, and a fix for Twitter Player Card URLs.

Although the new 'Meta Tags Preview' feature has been tested on several versions of WordPress, with several themes and a wide range of plugins, *it could expose some bugs in other plugins and / or themes*. **Please have a rollback plan in-place and tested before updating**. Worse case scenario, you can always login by FTP and remove the `nextgen-facebook/` plugin folder.

If you have an issue, refer to the 'Debug the Back-End' section in the [Debugging and Problem Solving](http://surniaulula.com/codex/plugins/nextgen-facebook/notes/debugging-and-problem-solving/) notes. The resulting debug.log may help you identify and fix a problem quickly. If you need additional support, GPL users can start a new thread in the [WordPress.org Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook) and Pro users can [Open a New Support Ticket](http://support.surniaulula.com/support/tickets/new). Please include any relevant errors from the debug.log.

* **Added a 'Meta Tags Preview' tab to the Custom Settings metabox**.
* Added warnings on the Post/Page editing page for images that are too small.
* Added support for embedded **YouTube playlists**.
* Added a hook into the WordPress 'get_image_tag' filter to include the 'data-wp-pid' attribute.
* Added a dashicon for the Open Graph+ menu item (if using WordPress v3.8 and up).
* Updated settings CSS for WordPress pre-v3.8 compatibility.
* Improved pattern matching for Media Library and NextGEN Gallery images in the content.
* Improved NextGEN Gallery v2 code to retrieve image dimensions, and check against required width / height values.
* Moved / renamed the `get_lang()` method to an `sucom_get_lang()` function in lib/com/functions.php.
* Fixed the unnecessary inclusion of social javascripts if no front-end buttons are enabled, but the back-end / admin sharing buttons were.
* Fixed an undefined variable in the BuddyPress addon (Pro version).
* **Fixed the Twitter 'Player Card' video URL to use an embed URL instead of a flash URL** (Pro version).
