Improve the appearance and ranking of WordPress Posts, Pages, and eCommerce Products in Google Search and social website shares

== Description ==

**NGFB Open Graph+ adds HTML meta tags (Open Graph, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards) to the head section of WordPress webpages for improved Google Search results and sharing on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr and many more -- An absolute essential plugin for every WordPress website!**

= Meta Tags =

NGFB Open Graph+ adds [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) (Facebook), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and (optionally) [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and most social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, keyword tags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). [See examples from Google Search / Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and others](/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/screenshots/).

Watch more videos about NGFB Open Graph+ on [Surnia Ulula's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SurniaUlulaCom).

NGFB Open Graph+ is a complete social sharing solution that uses the existing content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags - There's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings (although many settings and options *are* available).

**Twitter Cards**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) Twitter Cards, including configurable image sizes for each card type.

= Best Performance =

**NGFB Open Graph+ is fast and tuned for performance**, and unlike most plugins, makes full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching).

**NGFB Open Graph+ only loads the library files and object classes it needs**, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

= 3rd Party Integration =

**Images and Videos**

NGFB Open Graph+ detects and uses all images, associated or included in your Post / Page content, embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and Wistia (including preview images). NGFB Open Graph+ was specifically written to support albums, galleries and images from [NextGEN Gallery v1.x and v2.x](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) (shortcodes, image tags, album/gallery preview images, etc.), but also works just as well with the built-in WordPress Media Library (including WordPress galleries). NextGEN Gallery and Media Library images are resized appropriately for the Open Graph (Facebook) meta tags, the various Twitter Card formats, and sharing on Pinterest.

**Enhanced SEO**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) integrates with [WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [All in One SEO Pack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/), making sure your custom SEO settings are reflected in the Open Graph, Rich Pin, and Twitter Card meta tags.

**eCommerce Products**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) also supports [WooCommerce v1.x and v2.x](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), [MarketPress WordPress eCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-ecommerce/) and [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/) product pages, creating appropriate meta tags for [Facebook Products](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/payments/product/), [Twitter Product Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) and [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), including variations and additional / custom images.

**Forums and Social**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) supports [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) and [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) (see the [BuddyPress Integration Notes](http://surniaulula.com/codex/plugins/nextgen-facebook/notes/buddypress-integration/)), making sure your meta tags reflect the page content, including appropriate titles, descriptions, images, etc. Social sharing buttons can also be added to [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single template pages and [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activities.

= Social Buttons =

NGFB Open Graph+ comes with several social sharing buttons, that you can optionally include on Post / Page editing pages, above / below your content or excerpt, [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single pages, [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activity entries, as a widget, shortcode, or even a function call from your theme template(s). Each of the following social buttons can be enabled, configured, and styled individually:

* Facebook Like, Send, Share
* Google+
* LinkedIn
* ManageWP.org
* Pinterest
* StumbleUpon 
* Tumblr (Links, Quotes, Images, Videos)
* Twitter (Summary, Large Image Summary, Photo, Gallery, Player and Product Cards)

The Facebook, Google+ and Twitter social buttons support *multiple languages*. A default language can be chosen in the NGFB Open Graph+ settings, and the [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) switches the social button language with the webpage language (WordPress locale). NGFB Open Graph+ can also include hashtags, from WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tag names, in the Open Graph (Facebook) and Pinterest Rich Pin descriptions, Tweet text, and other social captions.

= Custom Contacts =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) allows you to customize the field names, label, and show / remove the following Contact Methods from the user profile page:

* AIM
* Facebook 
* Google+ 
* Jabber / Google Talk
* LinkedIn 
* Pinterest 
* Skype 
* Tumblr 
* Twitter 
* Yahoo IM
* YouTube

= Clean Uninstall =

**Try the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin with complete confidence** - when uninstalled, NGFB Open Graph+ removes *all* traces of itself from the database (options, site options, user and post meta, transients, etc.).

= Great Support =

**NGFB Open Graph+ is actively being developed and supported**. You can review the [FAQ](http://faq.ngfb.surniaulula.com/) and [Notes](http://notes.ngfb.surniaulula.com/) pages for additional setup information. If you have any suggestions or comments, post them to the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook) or the [Pro version support website](http://support.ngfb.surniaulula.com/).

= Pro Version =

The [GPL version](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) from WordPress.org is a full-featured, stable and well supported plugin. The [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) builds on this solid base by adding support for [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), e-commerce products ([WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), [MarketPress WordPress eCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-ecommerce/) and [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/)), tighter integration with SEO plugins ([WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [All in One SEO Pack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/)), enhanced customization features for *each individual Post and Page*, and dynamically changes the social button language to match the webpage. You can also enable a file cache for social images and JavaScripts (to further improve the page load times), and if you use a CDN or dedicated server to handle static content, the Pro version includes a URL rewriting feature (for encoded URLs that other rewriting plugins cannot detect).

Upgrading to the Pro version is simple and easy -- click on the "Purchase the Pro Version" button located on any NGFB Open Graph+ settings page, purchase the plugin through Paypal, then receive an email with your Authentication ID and update the plugin from within WordPress (like a regular plugin update).

= Multisite Aware =

The Pro version license(s) can be assigned to the whole multisite network and/or to specific sites within the multisite network. Note that the default site / blog must be licensed to allow Pro version updates from the Network Admin interface.

== Changelog ==

= Version 6.20.0 =

Version 6.20.0 centralizes much of the tooltip help text to make future translations easier. A bug in WooCommerce shortcodes has been found, and a work-around implented. An issue with the WordPress editor image size limits has been addressed as well - this version includes additional custom image sizes (ngfb-thumbnail/medium/large) that are not subject to the editor width limits.

* Fixed a WooCommerce bug, that redefined the $post variable when applying 'the_content' filter, by saving and restoring the $post variable.
* Added the WooCommerce query and shortcode classes when in admin interface to expand its shortcode for the Meta Tags Preview tab (Pro version).
* Added ngfb-thumbnail/medium/large custom image sizes, with identical values to those of WordPress, to bypass the `editor_max_image_size()` limits.
* Moved much of the tooltip help text into lib/messages.php to facilitate future translations.
* Removed the NGFB_OG_SIZE_NAME constant.

= Version 6.19.0 =

**There are several important changes in v6.19.0, including one that pushes some limits in the admin interface**.

You'll find a new 'Meta Tags Preview' tab in the Custom Settings metabox, available on the Post and Page editing pages. Since the core functionality of NGFB Open Graph+ is to create complete and accurate meta tags, I felt it was important to provide an easier / faster way to visualize them. By generating the meta tags on the admin / back-end, it's also now possible to warn of images that are too small (smaller than the plugin's configured settings). Two other notable changes are the added support for embedded YouTube Playlists, and a fix for Twitter Player Card URLs.

Although the new 'Meta Tags Preview' feature has been tested on several versions of WordPress, with several themes and a wide range of plugins, *it could expose some bugs in other plugins and / or themes*. **Please have a rollback plan in-place and tested before updating**. Worse case scenario, you can always login by FTP and remove the `nextgen-facebook/` plugin folder.

If you have an issue, refer to the 'Debug the Back-End' section in the [Debugging and Problem Solving](http://surniaulula.com/codex/plugins/nextgen-facebook/notes/debugging-and-problem-solving/) notes. The resulting debug.log may help you identify and fix a problem quickly. If you need additional support, GPL users can start a new thread in the [WordPress.org Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook) and Pro users can [Open a New Support Ticket](http://support.surniaulula.com/support/tickets/new). Please include any relevant errors from the debug.log.

* **Added a 'Meta Tags Preview' tab to the Custom Settings metabox**.
* Added warnings on the Post/Page editing page for images that are too small.
* Added support for embedded **YouTube playlists**.
* Added a hook into the WordPress 'get_image_tag' filter to include the 'data-wp-pid' attribute.
* Added a dashicon for the Open Graph+ menu item (if using WordPress v3.8 and up).
* Updated settings CSS for WordPress pre-v3.8 compatibility.
* Improved pattern matching for Media Library and NextGEN Gallery images in the content.
* Improved NextGEN Gallery v2 code to retrieve image dimensions, and check against required width / height values.
* Moved / renamed the `get_lang()` method to an `sucom_get_lang()` function in lib/com/functions.php.
* Fixed the unnecessary inclusion of social javascripts if no front-end buttons are enabled, but the back-end / admin sharing buttons were.
* Fixed an undefined variable in the BuddyPress addon (Pro version).
* **Fixed the Twitter 'Player Card' video URL to use an embed URL instead of a flash URL** (Pro version).
