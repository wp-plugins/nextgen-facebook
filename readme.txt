Improve the appearance and ranking of WordPress Posts, Pages, and eCommerce Products in Google Search and social website shares

== Description ==

NGFB Open Graph+ adds HTML tags (Open Graph, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards) to the head section of WordPress webpages for improved Google Search results and sharing on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr and many more -- an essential plugin for every WordPress website!

= Social and SEO =

NGFB Open Graph+ adds [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) HTML tags to the head section of webpages. These HTML tags are used by Google Search and most social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, keyword tags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). [See examples from Google Search, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and others](/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/screenshots/).

Watch more videos about NGFB Open Graph+ on [Surnia Ulula's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SurniaUlulaCom).

NGFB Open Graph+ is a *complete* social sharing solution that uses the existing content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags -- there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings (although many settings and options *are* available).

= Images and Videos =

NGFB Open Graph+ detects and uses all images, associated or included in your webpage content, embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and Wistia (including preview images). NGFB Open Graph+ was specifically written to support albums, galleries and images from [NextGEN Gallery v1.x and v2.x](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) (shortcodes, image tags, album/gallery preview images, etc.), but also works just as well with the built-in WordPress Media Library.

= Twitter Cards =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) also provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) Cards, including configurable image sizes for each card type.

= eCommerce Products =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) supports [WooCommerce v1.x and v2.x](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), [MarketPress WordPress eCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-ecommerce/) and [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/) product pages, creating appropriate meta tags for [Facebook Products](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/payments/product/), [Twitter Product Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) and [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/). 

* WooCommerce support offers product prices, currency, image galleries, stock status, weight, dimensions, extended attributes, category and tag pages.
* MarketPress WordPress eCommerce support offers product prices, currency, variations, sale prices, images and inventory levels.
* WP e-Commerce support features product prices, currency, images, custom meta and category pages.

= Forums =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) supports [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/), which includes the main Forum index page, individual Forum pages, topics, topic tags, replies, and profile pages.

= HashTags =

NGFB Open Graph+ can include WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tag names, converted to hastags, in the Open Graph / Rich Pin description, tweet text and social captions.

= Optional Social Buttons =

NGFB Open Graph+ comes with several social sharing buttons, that you can optionally include on the Post / Page editing page, above / below your content or excerpt, as a widget, shortcode, or even call as a function from your theme template(s). Each of the following social buttons can be enabled, configured, and styled individually:

* Facebook
* Google+
* LinkedIn
* ManageWP.org
* Pinterest
* StumbleUpon 
* Tumblr (Links, Quotes, Images, Videos)
* Twitter (Summary, Large Image Summary, Photo, Gallery, Player and Product Cards)

The Facebook, Google+ and Twitter social buttons support *multiple languages*. A default language can be chosen in the NGFB Open Graph+ settings, and the [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) matches the social button language with the webpage language (WordPress locale).

= Custom Contacts =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) allows you to customize the field names, label, and show / remove the following Contact Methods from the user profile page:

* AIM
* Facebook 
* Google+ 
* Jabber / Google Talk
* LinkedIn 
* Pinterest 
* Skype 
* Tumblr 
* Twitter 
* Yahoo IM
* YouTube

= Best Performance =

**NGFB Open Graph+ is fast and tuned for performance**, and unlike most plugins, makes full use of all available caching techniques as well (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching).

NGFB Open Graph+ only includes the PHP library files and creates the object classes it needs, thus having a *much smaller footprint / size* than most other full featured plugins.

= Clean Uninstall =

Try the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin with complete confidence -- when uninstalled, NGFB Open Graph+ removes *all* traces of itself from the database (options, site options, user and post meta, transients, etc.).

= Great Support =

**NGFB Open Graph+ is actively being developed and supported**. You can review the [FAQ](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/faq/) and [Other Notes](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/other_notes/) pages for additional setup information. If you have any suggestions or comments, post them to the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook) or the [Pro version support website](http://support.surniaulula.com/support/home).

= Developer Friendly =

NGFB Open Graph+ also offers a [wide variety of filter hooks](http://support.surniaulula.com/support/solutions/articles/1000000153-filter-hooks), functions, methods and [constants](http://support.surniaulula.com/solution/articles/1000000154-constants) to customize the output and behavior of the plugin.

= Pro Version =

The [GPL version](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) from WordPress.org is a full-featured, stable and well supported plugin. The [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) builds on this solid base by adding support for [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), e-commerce products ([WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), [MarketPress WordPress eCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-ecommerce/) and [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/)), tighter integration with SEO plugins ([WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [All in One SEO Pack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/)), enhanced customization features for *each individual Post and Page*, and dynamically changes the social button language to match the webpage. You can also enable a file cache for social images and JavaScripts (to further improve the page load times), and if you use a CDN or dedicated server to handle static content, the Pro version includes a URL rewriting feature (for encoded URLs that other rewriting plugins cannot detect).

Upgrading to the Pro version is simple and easy -- click on the "Purchase the Pro Version" button located on any NGFB Open Graph+ settings page, purchase the plugin through Paypal, then receive an email with your Authentication ID and update the plugin from within WordPress (like a regular plugin update).

= Multisite Aware =

The Pro version license(s) can be assigned to the whole multisite network and/or to specific sites within the multisite network. Note that the default site / blog must be licensed to allow Pro version updates from the Network Admin interface.

== Installation ==

= Install Methods =

To install the [GPL version](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) from WordPress.org, follow the *Automated Install* method described bellow.

If you have purchased the [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/), an email will be sent to you with Authentication ID and installation instructions. Enter your Authentication ID on the Advanced settings page of the GPL version, and after saving the changes, an update will appear on the WordPress Updates page. Update the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin from within WordPress, as you would any other plugin, to download and activate the new Pro version.

If you downloaded the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin as an archive file -- either [the Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) or [other GPL versions from WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/developers/) -- follow the *Automated Removal* (if NGFB Open Graph+ is already installed) and the *Semi-Automated Install* methods to remove, install, and activate the new plugin. Please take care to check the "Preserve on Uninstall" option on the Advanced settings page before removing the plugin (as explained in the *Automated Removal* procedure).

If you need to roll-back and re-install an older GPL version, you can find them all on the [WordPress.org Developers](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/developers/) page.

**Automated Install** (GPL version)

1. Go to the wp-admin/ section of your website

1. In the *Search* box, enter "NGFB Open Graph"
1. Click the *Search Plugins* button
1. Click the *Install Now* link for "NGFB Open Graph"
1. Click the *Activate Plugin* link

**Semi-Automated Install** (GPL and Pro versions)

Note that if you already have NGFB Open Graph+ installed, you will have to remove it first, before you can re-install it using this method.

1. Download the plugin archive file (either [the Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) or [from WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/developers/))
1. Go to the wp-admin/ section of your website
1. Select the *Plugins* menu item
1. Select the *Add New* sub-menu item
1. Click on *Upload* link (just under the Install Plugins page title)
1. Click the *Browser...* button
1. Navigate your local folders / directories and choose the zip file you downloaded previously
1. Click on the *Install Now* button
1. Click the *Activate Plugin* link

**Manual Install** (GPL and Pro versions)

1. Download and unzip the plugin archive file (either [the Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) or [from WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/developers/))
1. Upload the entire nextgen-facebook/ folder to your website's wordpress/wp-content/plugins/ directory

1. Scroll down to the "NGFB Open Graph+" plugin, and click its *Activate* link

Once installed and activated, the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin will start adding all the essential Open Graph meta tags to your webpages immediately -- there's no need to configure any additional settings. Although if you have at least one image in your Media Library or [NextGEN Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) that represents your website, you may want to define that one as your Default Image on the General Settings page.

The plugin settings are available under an *Open Graph* admin menu, where you can select a default image, include social buttons in your content, change the shared thumbnail image size, and much, much more.

= Uninstall Methods =

**Automated Removal**

1. Go to the wp-admin/ section of your website
1. Select the *Open Graph* menu item
1. Select the *Advanced* sub-menu item
1. Check the "Preserve on Uninstall" option if you would like to keep NGFB Open Graph+ settings in the database.
1. Select the *Plugins* menu item
1. Select the *Installed Plugins* sub-menu
1. Scroll down to the "NGFB Open Graph+" plugin, and click its *Deactivate* link
1. Scroll down to the "NGFB Open Graph+" plugin, and click its *Delete* link

If you have the Pro version, you may also contact me by email (simply reply to the email you received when purchasing the Pro version).

== Debugging and Problem Solving ==

NGFB Open Graph+ follows the latest recommended WordPress coding practices, but on occasion, it may break *other* themes and/or plugins that do not.

= WordPress Content Filters =

WordPress allows plugins and themes to hook into various filters, which are then used by WordPress to expand shortcodes, etc. WordPress generally calls a filter (like 'the_content') once to expand text for the webpage. As a consequence, some authors mistakenly assume that a filter they have created will only be executed once. WordPress filters are available to any theme and/or plugin that needs to expand text (title, excerpt, content, etc.), which NGFB Open Graph+ uses to provide a complete and accurate meta tag description (as an example).

On the Open Graph+ Advanced settings page, you can uncheck the 'Apply Content Filters' and 'Apply Excerpt Filters' to see if your problem is related to a WordPress filter hook. If unchecking these options fixes your problem, you should determine which filter is at fault and report the issue with the theme and/or plugin author. Using the WordPress `apply_filters()` function more than once should not break a theme and/or plugin.

As an alternative to disabling content / excerpt filters, you can also use a custom 'Default Description' in the Custom Settings metabox located on most Pages and Posts. NGFB Open Graph+ will then use the custom description instead of applying filters to generate a description from the content.

= Debug and Error Messages =

Turning on the WordPress debug log can be highly illuminating -- your theme and plugins may be generating many errors, which you would never see unless you turn on the WordPress debug log. To enable the WordPress debug log, without displaying the errors to your visitors, add the following to your `wp-config.php` file.

`
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
if ( defined('WP_DEBUG') && WP_DEBUG == true ) {
	define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
	define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
	@ini_set('display_errors',0);
}
`

NGFB Open Graph+ can also generate debug / activity messages by ckecking the 'Add Hidden Debug Info' on the Open Graph+ Advanced settings page. The debug messages will be added directly to the webpage as HTML comments, to allow debugging issues remotely. You can also define the following constant to enable the same behavior.

`
define('NGFB_HTML_DEBUG', true);
`

If you would like to send NGFB Open Graph+ debug messages to the WordPress log file instead (or as well), you can define the following constant.

`
define('NGFB_WP_DEBUG', true);
`

== Multisite ==

NGFB Open Graph+ is multisite aware and provides a network settings page in the Network Admin interface. [See the Multisite Support solutions page for additional information](http://support.surniaulula.com/support/solutions/articles/1000000140-multisite-support).

== Twitter Cards ==

Your website must be 'authorized' by Twitter for each type of Twitter Card. NGFB Open Graph+ Pro supports the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) Cards. For each type card, you must submit a sample URL from your website to Twitter's validation tool:

1. Make sure the 'Enable Twitter Cards' option is checked on NGFB Open Graph+ Pro's General settings page.
1. Go to Twitter's [Card Validator](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator).
1. 'Cancel' the Card Catalog popup (these are just examples).
1. Choose the 'Validate &amp; Apply' tab.
1. Enter an example URL from your website for the Twitter Card you would like to get approved. The Twitter Card type depends on the webpage content (see following).
1. If the Twitter Card type has not been approved yet, you may click on the 'Request Approval' button.
1. Fill-in and submit the form.

NGFB Open Graph+ Pro creates the Twitter Cards based on the content of your webpages.

* Product : Product information from a supported e-commerce plugin.
* Player : An embedded video in the content from YouTube, Vimeo, or Wistia.
* Gallery Card : Provided by NextGEN Gallery shortcodes (*nggalbum*, *nggallery*, and *nggtags*).
* Photo Card : An Attachment or NextGEN Gallery ImageBrowser webpage.
* Large Image Summary Card : An image defined in the Post or Page Metabox, a Featured, Attached, or NextGEN Gallery *singlepic* shortcode image. 
* Summary : All other webpages.

An 'ngfb_tc' filter hook is also available to customize the Twitter Card meta tags.

== Shortcodes ==

You can add one or more social sharing buttons to your content by using the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode. **The "Enable Shortcode" option must be enabled on the NGFB settings page** (disabled by default).

`
&#91;ngfb buttons="facebook, gplus, linkedin, pinterest, stumbleupon, tumblr, twitter"&#93;
`

You may use several arguments:

* `buttons` : A list of buttons to include, as shown in the example above.
* `url` : A specific URL to share, instead of the current webpage or Post URL.
* `pid` : A picture ID to share for the Pinterest and Tumblr buttons. NextGEN Gallery picture IDs must be in the form of 'ngg-#' (for example: `pid="ngg-123"`).
* `photo` : A specific photo / image URL to share for the Pinterest and Tumblr buttons. The `photo` argument takes precedence over the `pid` argument.
* `css_class` : A CSS class name.
* `css_id` : A CSS id name.

Note that by default (like all other methods used to add NGFB social buttons), a *featured* or *attached* image must be present for the Pinterest button to show (unless the `pid` or `photo` argument is used).

== Stylesheets ==

= Social Buttons Style =

NGFB Open Graph+ uses several layers of classes to describe all its social buttons, and each button has it's own individual class name and id as well. You may add styling for social buttons to an existing stylesheet (from your theme, for example), or use the built-in stylesheet editor found on the Social Style settings page.

The default styles offer a fairly complete example of CSS styling for the NGFB social buttons. In the default Social Buttons Style section I've specified the width (and height) for each button's `<div>`. This takes a little more work to get right, but *pre-defining the height and width of each button helps the page rendering speed significantly*. The `.ngfb-buttons` class is included within one of four other classes: `.ngfb-content-buttons` and `.ngfb-excerpt-buttons` for buttons enabled on the Social Sharing settings page, `.ngfb-widget-buttons` for buttons enabled from the widget, and `.ngfb-shortcode-buttons` for buttons added using the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode.

= Hide Social Buttons =

You can also hide the social buttons (or pretty much any object) in a webpage or post by using `display:none` in your stylesheet. As an example, if you use the "Inspect Element" feature of Firefox (right-click on the object to inspect) -- or use "View Source" to see the webpage's HTML -- you should find your content wrapped in a `<div>` HTML tag similar to this one:

`
<div class="postid-123 post type-post status-publish format-standard 
	hentry category-test category-wordpress tag-css tag-html">
		The post content text...
</div>
`

You could use any of these class names to hide one or more NGFB social buttons enabled on the settings page. For example, the following stylesheet hides the social buttons on Post <em>123</em>, any page in category <em>Test</em>, and posts using the Aside and Status formats:

`
.post-123 .ngfb-buttons,
.category-test .ngfb-buttons,
.format-aside .ngfb-buttons,
.format-status .ngfb-buttons { display:none; }
`

[The Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) also includes a Custom Settings checkbox to enable/disable social buttons on each Post and Page without the use of CSS.

== Performance Tuning ==

The code for NGFB is highly optimized -- the plugin will not load or execute code it does not have to. And unlike most plugins, NGFB Open Graph+ makes full use of all available caching techniques:

* Non-persistent ([WP Object Cache](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache)) object caching for rendered (filtered) Post and Page content.
* Persitent ([Transient API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API)) object caching for the Open Graph meta tags, social buttons widget, shortcodes and content social buttons.
* Using an optional file / disk based cache for javascript and images from social websites (Pro version).

= Tuning the Plugin Settings =

You may consider the following option settings to fine-tune the plugin for optimal performance.

* If your website content does not have any embedded videos, or you prefer not to include information on embedded videos in your Open Graph meta property tags, you can set the "Maximum Number of Videos" to "0". This will prevent the plugin from searching your content text for embedded videos.

* If you generally have a *featured* image for your posts and pages, you may set the "Maximum Number of Images" to "1". This will prevent the plugin from searching your content for additional images (the *featured* image counts as "1" and the plugin will stop there).

* For posts and pages, if no excerpt text has been entered, the content text is used to define the Open Graph description meta property value. If you generally don't use excerpts, and your content does not rely on shortcodes or plugins to render its text, you may uncheck the "Apply Content Filters" option.

* If you don't use the `&#91;ngfb&#93;` shortcode, you can uncheck the "Enable Shortcode" option if it has been enabled (the default is unchecked).

* If your infrastructure can serve JavaScript and image files faster and more reliably than Facebook, Google+, etc., you can set the "File Cache Expiry" option in the Pro version to several hours (the default of "0" hours disables this option).

* If the featured image, excerpt (or content text), etc., is not generally revised after publishing, you can increase the "Object Cache Expiry" option from 300 seconds (the default) to 600 or even 900 seconds.

= Defragment the Database =

The database tables in MySQL can become fragmented as entries are added/removed/updated, especially the options table which holds the transient object cache entries. You should defragment you database tables at least daily. I use [Phil Dufault's `mysqlfragfinder.sh`](https://github.com/pdufault/mysqlfragfinder) script for my own databases.

Here is an example crontab entry:

`
# defragment mysql tables
0 3 * * *       export TERM=vt100; /usr/local/bin/mysqlfragfinder.sh >/var/tmp/mysqlfragfinder.log
`

And to prevent the script from stopping for a password, add an entry for it in the `~/.my.cnf` file:

== Advanced Usage ==

= Include Social Buttons from Template File(s) =

The `ngfb_get_social_buttons()` function can be used to include social buttons anywhere in your template files. As an example, the following PHP code includes the Facebook, Google+, and Twitter social buttons from within a loop, post, or page (the `$post->ID` must be available):

`
<?php if ( function_exists( 'ngfb_get_social_buttons' ) ) 
	echo ngfb_get_social_buttons( array( 'facebook', 'gplus', 'twitter' ) ); ?>
`

The social button names for the array can be "facebook", "gplus", "linkedin", "pinterest", "stumbleupon", "tumblr", and "twitter".

You can also use the `ngfb_get_social_buttons()` function *outside* of a loop, post, or page, but you will have to provide additional information to the function. Since the `$post` variable is not available outside of a loop (to get the permalink), at a minimum you will have to provide the webpage URL. Here's an example from a custom NextGEN Gallery template (plugins/nextgen-gallery/view/): 

`
if ( function_exists( 'ngfb_get_social_buttons' ) ) { 
	$url = empty( $_SERVER['HTTPS'] ) ? 'http://' : 'https://';
	$url .= $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"].$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];
	echo ngfb_get_social_buttons( array( 'pinterest', 'tumblr' ),
		array ( 'pid' => 'ngg-'.$image->pid, 'url' => $url, 'caption' => $image->caption ) );
}
`

This creates a Pinterest and Tumblr button to share a picture from a NextGEN Gallery, sets the URL to the current webpage address, and uses the picture's caption as well. All social buttons, besides Pinterest and Tumblr, only need the URL defined.

= Disable Open Graph Meta Tags =

You can exclude the Open Graph meta tags from being added to certain webpages. You must set the `NGFB_OPEN_GRAPH_DISABLE` constant to true in your theme's header.php before the `wp_head()` function. Here's an example that disables NGFB's meta tags for image search results (a custom 'meta' template is called to define the Open Graph tags):

`
global $nggSearch
if ( is_search() && $nggSearch->found_images ) {
	define( 'NGFB_OPEN_GRAPH_DISABLE', true );
	echo $nggSearch->return_result( 'meta' );
}
wp_head();
`

= URL Rewriting =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) provides advanced URL rewriting features, allowing you to rewrite URLs in the Open Graph meta tags, *encoded image URLs* shared by social buttons (Pinterest and Tumblr), and cached social media files. As an example, <u>http://mydomain.com/wp-content/gallery/test/image.jpg</u> can be rewritten as <u>http://static.mydomain.com/wp-content/gallery/test/image.jpg</u>. The <em>Static Content URL(s)</em> option value for this example would be <em>http://static.mydomain.com/</em>.

You can also enter multiple comma-delimited values, and use numbered wildcards like <em>http://cdn%3%.static.mydomain.com/</em> for example (which expands to cdn1, cdn2, and cdn3), or <em>http://cdn%4-6%.static.mydomain.com/</em> (which expands to cdn4, cdn5, and cdn6). If wildcards or multiple <em>Static Content URL(s)</em> are entered, a random URL in the range is chosen for each rewrite.

= NGFB Filter Hooks =

Several [filter hooks](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter) are available within the [NGFB Open Graph+](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) plugin to manipulate text (title, description, content, etc.) and arrays (tags, open graph, etc.). [All NGFB Filter Hooks are documented on the Pro version support website](http://support.surniaulula.com/support/solutions/articles/1000000153-filter-hooks).

== Changelog ==

= Version 6.16.2 =

* Improved the management of html encoded and non-encoded strings internally. The `get_title()` and `get_description()` methods now return encoded strings. The `limit_text_length()` method decodes and re-encodes the text after shortening. The 'ngfb_title', 'ngfb_description', and 'ngfb_caption' filters will now receive encoded strings.
* Improved the detection of 3rd party plugins for conflict and addon support checks by verifying loaded class/function names, plus the active plugins array from WordPress.
* Changed the Wistia v1 API call for the new oembed SEO API call (which doesn't need a password).
* Removed the 'Wistia API Password' option, which is no longer required for the API call.

= Version 6.16.1 =

NGFB Open Graph+ version 6.16.1 completes support for all Wistia video formats by adding recognition for the inline embed API / SEO and popover embed video formats. A new Sharing URL option has also been added to the Open Graph+ Custom Settings metabox on the Edit Post/Page admin pages. This option will reflect any changes made by WordPress SEO by Yoast, and allows you to customize the URL for tracking purposes – just make sure your modified custom URL functions correctly before publishing your Post / Page. ;-)

This release also includes two minor fixes – the onFocus and onBlur events in the Open Graph+ Custom Settings metabox was not working properly, and during an earlier code optimization / re-organization, two Pro addon classes – WordPress SEO and All-In-One SEO Pack -  were left with incorrect class names.

Please note: If you use the ‘ngfb_sharing_url’ filter, the argument list for that filter has changed.

* **Added support for Wistia inline embed API / SEO and popover embed video formats**. (Pro version)
* Added a Sharing URL option to the Open Graph+ Custom Settings metabox. (Pro version)
* Added a fallback to using the custom Video URL as-is if the URL is not recognized / supported. (Pro Version)
* Added a check for enabled 'Preserve Settings on Uninstall' option, and if enabled, disable the 'Reset Settings on Activate' option.
* Removed the `NGFB_MIN_IMG_SIZE_DISABLE` constant (since an option exists for the same feature).
* Renamed the &lt;img/&gt; 'share' attribute to 'data-share-src'.
* Moved the options upgrade properies / methods to lib/upgrade.php (saving a few Kb of memory).
* Improved / optimized the loading of plugin and form settings when in the admin interface.
* Added error suppression when parsing HTML from Youtube.
* Fixed the Custom Settings onFocus / onBlur events character encoding for input fields (so the events work correctly with hastags).
* **Fixed the All-In-One SEO Pack and WordPress SEO class names, which didn't match the plugin's configured class names**. (Pro version)
* Changed the 'ngfb_sharing_url' filter arguments from `( $url, $source_id )` to `( $url, $use_post, $add_page, $source_id )`.

= Version 6.16.0.1 =

* Fixed a small typo in the WordPress SEO addon (Pro version).

= Version 6.16.0 =

**NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) now supports bbPress forums**. Since bbPress content - as retrieved from WordPress - contains the whole page, including breadcrumbs, replies, etc., a specific addon was necessary to provide accurate descriptions. Support includes the main Forum index page, individual Forum pages, topics, topic tags, replies, and profile pages. This version also includes many changes to the code in order to accomodate the WordPress `get_queried_object()` function. This was necessary to support broken themes that do not provide a `$post` object for their custom post types.

* **Added support for bbPress forums, topics, tags and profiles** (Pro version).
* Fixed the Auto-Resize feature by adding the missing call to `wp_update_attachment_metadata()` in order to save the new size information.
* Added a 'Site Description' option to customize the WordPress Tagline value (used as the description on the home index page).
* Renamed the 'URL Shortening' tab, on the Advanced settings page, to 'API Keys'.
* Added a 'Google URL Shortener API is On' option to validate that the service has been enabled in the Google Cloud Console.
* Added detection of Gravatar image URLs in the content text.
* Improved the `flush_post_cache()` method to include wp_cache objects (which may be persistant).
* Improved the `get_sharing_url()` method to provide more accurate canonical URLs.
* Improved the `reset_metabox_prefs()` method reset only individual metaboxes, not the whole settings page.
* Added a new `ngfb_get_term_url` filter for better WordPress SEO support (Pro version).
* Added new `ngfb_get_meta_options`, `ngfb_save_meta_options`, and `ngfb_get_meta_defaults` filters for the post meta options array (Pro version).
* Added a call to `wp_cache_add_non_persistent_groups()` for the content object cache group (the content cache object does not need to be persistent).
* Modified several methods to try and use `get_queried_object()` first, instead of the global $post object. This should circumvent broken themes that do not setup/create the global $post object properly.
* Moved the 'Add Page Title in Tags' and 'Add Page Ancestor Tags' options to the Title and Description tab.
* Replaced the `NGFB_WISTIA_API_PWD` constant with a 'Wistia API Password' option on the Advanced settings page.
* Added a fallback HTTP request for Youtube videos without a width and height (which is missing from their API).
* Renamed the `get_short_url()` method to `shorten_url()`.
* Renamed the 'ngfb_short_url' filter to 'ngfb_shorten_url'.
* Added lib/pro/shorten.php which provides the `short()` method and creates the NgfbGoogl and NgfbBitly class objects (Pro version).
