= Complete Meta Tags =

NGFB Open Graph+ adds [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) (Facebook), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and (optionally) [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and most Social Websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, keyword tags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). [See a few examples from Google Search / Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and others](/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/screenshots/). 

NGFB Open Graph+ is a complete social sharing solution that uses the *existing* content of your webpages to build HTML meta tags -- There's no need to manually enter / configure any additional values or settings (although many settings and options *are* available).

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) Twitter Cards, including configurable image sizes for each card type.

= Best Performance =

**NGFB Open Graph+ is fast and tuned for performance**, and unlike most plugins, makes full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching).

**NGFB Open Graph+ only loads the library files and object classes it needs**, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

= 3rd Party Integration =

Aside from the additional support for Twitter Cards, the main difference between the GPL and Pro versions is the integration of 3rd party plugins and services.

**Images and Videos**

NGFB Open Graph+ detects and uses all images - associated or included in your Post or Page content - including WordPress Media Library image galleries and embedded videos from Slideshare, Vimeo, Wistia, and Youtube (including their preview images). WordPress Media Library images (and NextGEN Gallery in the Pro version) are resized and provided according to their intended audience (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc). 

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) also includes support for [JetPack Photon](http://jetpack.me/support/photon/) and [NextGEN Gallery v1 and v2](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).

**Enhanced SEO**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) integrates with [WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [All in One SEO Pack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/), making sure your custom SEO settings are reflected in the Open Graph, Rich Pin, and Twitter Card meta tags.

**eCommerce Products**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) also supports [WooCommerce v1 and v2](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), [MarketPress WordPress eCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-ecommerce/) and [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/) product pages, creating appropriate meta tags for [Facebook Products](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/payments/product/), [Twitter Product Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) and [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), including poduct variations (size, color, etc.) and additional / custom images.

**Forums and Social**

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) supports [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) and [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) (see the [BuddyPress Integration Notes](http://surniaulula.com/codex/plugins/nextgen-facebook/notes/buddypress-integration/)), making sure your meta tags reflect the page content, including appropriate titles, descriptions, images, etc. Social sharing buttons can also be added to [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single template pages and [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activities.

= Social Buttons =

NGFB Open Graph+ comes with several social sharing buttons, that you can optionally include on Post / Page editing pages, above / below your content or excerpt, [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) single pages, [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) activity entries, as a widget, shortcode, or even a function call from your theme template(s). Each of the following social buttons can be enabled, configured, and styled individually:

* Facebook Like, Send, Share
* Google+
* LinkedIn
* ManageWP.org
* Pinterest
* StumbleUpon 
* Tumblr (Links, Quotes, Images, Videos)
* Twitter (Summary, Large Image Summary, Photo, Gallery, Player and Product Cards)

The Facebook, Google+ and Twitter social buttons support *multiple languages*. A default language can be chosen in the NGFB Open Graph+ settings, and the [Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) switches the social button language with the webpage language (WordPress locale). NGFB Open Graph+ can also include hashtags, from WordPress and NextGEN Gallery tag names, in the Open Graph (Facebook) and Pinterest Rich Pin descriptions, Tweet text, and other social captions.

= Custom Contacts =

NGFB Open Graph+ (Pro version) allows you to customize the field names, label, and show / remove the following Contact Methods from the user profile page:

* AIM
* Facebook 
* Google+ 
* Jabber / Google Talk
* LinkedIn 
* Pinterest 
* Skype 
* Tumblr 
* Twitter 
* Yahoo IM
* YouTube

= Clean Uninstall =

**Try the NGFB Open Graph+ plugin with complete confidence** - when uninstalled, NGFB Open Graph+ removes *all* traces of itself from the database (options, site options, user and post meta, transients, etc.).

= Great Support =

**NGFB Open Graph+ support and development is on-going**. You can review the [FAQ](http://faq.ngfb.surniaulula.com/) and [Notes](http://notes.ngfb.surniaulula.com/) pages for additional setup information. If you have any suggestions or comments, post them to the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook) or the [Pro version support website](http://support.ngfb.surniaulula.com/).

== Changelog ==

= Version 7.0rc10 =

This version continues several underlying code improvements by moving the GPL-only code into a `lib/gpl/` folder structure (like the Pro version) and adding several filter hooks to improve the overall modularity of the plugin. Relying on existing WordPress image size names -- like *thumbnail*, *medium* and *large* -- has been too limiting, so new individual image dimensions have been added for each image context. You'll find new image dimension settings for all Twitter Card formats, along with the Pinterest and Tumblr sharing buttons. Please make sure you review these new image dimensions and adjust them for your needs. The defaults should be fine, but you may prefer to match your existing image sizes to reduce the number of resized image files. For example, some of the larger image dimensions default to 800x800 uncropped. If you already have an image size of 1024x1024 uncropped, for example, you may wish to use those dimensions instead.

Version 7.0 has been in development longer than most other versions (minor versions are often released every week or two) -- during this time, I had the chance to develop and test a new floating sidebar feature for the social sharing buttons. It took some time to integrate and get right, but I think the results were well worth it. You can now include social sharing buttons in your content text, excerpts, as a widget, shortcode, using a function in your templates, on admin editing pages, and now as floating sidebar as well! :) You can include buttons in the floating sidebar by checking the "Sidebar" options on the Social Sharing settings page. You'll find the CSS and JavaScript for the sidebar on the Social Style settings page.

This version also includes a new 'Preset Options' tab on the Social Sharing settings page. These presets are meant to override the default button settings for specific locations -- like the admin editing page and the floating sidebar. The default sidebar CSS has been designed to use the larger sharing buttons with vertical counters, so the presets allow the buttons to be configured correctly for the sidebar. If you'd like to use smaller buttons in the sidebar, you should choose '[none]' as the Sidebar Preset, and adjust the Sidebar Style accordingly. By default, the sidebr is located 495px left of center, and 20% down from the top. You'll probably have to adjust this for your own theme layout.

The code base for NGFB Open Graph+ has also been used to fork the [WordPress Social Sharing Optimization](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/) (WPSSO) plugin -- it has many features in common with NGFB Open Graph+, but strives to be a little lighter and smaller by removing the social buttons and their related features (shortcodes, widgets, stylesheets, javascript caching, url shortening, and url rewriting). You can achieve the same results with NGFB Open Graph+ by setting the `NGFB_SOCIAL_SHARING_DISABLE` constant to `true` in your `wp-config.php` file.

This restores balance between the two distributions - [the NGFB Open Graph+ GPL version from WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) offers complete support for Open Graph+ meta tags, the WordPress Media Library (including its `gallery` shortcode), and social sharing buttons, while the Pro version includes support for 3rd party plugins and services (like NextGEN Gallery, WordPress SEO, BuddyPress, bbPress, WooCommerce, Wistia videos, etc.). I remain committed to providing a complete and reliable set of features in the GPL version - all for free. There's no need to contribute in any way, though a little [help with forum questions](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nextgen-facebook), for example, is always welcome. ;-)
