PHP Constants for NextGEN Facebook Open Graph

To address very specific needs, some PHP constants for NGFB may be defined in
your wp-config.php or template files (generally before the wp_head() function
call). 

NGFB_DEBUG

	Set this constant to 'true' to turn on hidden debug messages, and use
	"View Source" on any webpage to view the debug messages. An
	informational message box will also be displayed in admin pages as
	reminder that debug mode is on.

NGFB_WP_DEBUG

	Send debug messages to PHP's error_log() as well.

NGFB_RESET

	Set this contant to 'true' to reset all options to their defaults when
	the plugin is activated.

NGFB_OPEN_GRAPH_DISABLE

	Set this contant to 'true' to prevent the plugin from adding Open
	Graph meta tags in the webpage head section. See "Disable Open Graph
	Meta Tags" above for an example of it's use.

NGFB_MIN_IMG_SIZE_DISABLE

	Set this contant to 'true' to disable the minimum width and height
	checks for the <img/> attributes in the content. All images, no matter
	their size, will be added to the Open Graph meta tags. See "Why does
	NGFB ignore the <img/> HTML tags in my content?" on the FAQ page
	for additional information.

NGFB_OPTIONS_NAME

	The options field name in the database for NGFB. The default value is
	'ngfb_options'.

NGFB_MENU_PRIORITY

	Adjust the location of the "Open Graph" menu. The default value is
	"99.10".

NGFB_HEAD_PRIORITY

	Change the execution priority of the method that adds JavaScript and
	Open Graph meta tags to the head section. The default value is 5.

NGFB_SOCIAL_PRIORITY

	Change the execution priority for the method that adds social buttons
	to the content. The default value is 100.

NGFB_FOOTER_PRIORITY

	Change the execution priority for the method that adds JavaScript to
	the footer section. The default value is 10.

NGFB_MIN_DESC_LEN

	The minimum allowed description length value. The default is 160. A
	maximum description length value is configurable on the settings page,
	but any value entered bellow NGFB_MIN_DESC_LEN will be changed to
	NGFB_MIN_DESC_LEN when saved.

NGFB_MIN_IMG_SIZE

	The minimum image width and height suggested on the settings page. The
	default value is 200.

NGFB_MAX_IMG_OG

	The maximum range shown in the "Maximum Number of Images" drop-down on
	the settings page. The default value is 20.

NGFB_MAX_VID_OG

	The maximum range shown in the "Maximum Number of Videos" drop-down on
	the settings page. The default value is 20.

NGFB_MAX_CACHE

	The maximum range shown in the "Cache Expiry in Hours" drop-down on
	the settings page. The default value is 24.

NGFB_CONTACT_FIELDS

	The field names and labels for the additional user profile fields. The
	default value is "facebook:Facebook URL,gplus:Google+ URL". See the

	additional information.

NGFB_CURL_DISABLE

	Disable all use of PHP's curl functions (all NGFB file caching
	features will be disabled).

NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT

	Used by the remote content caching feature for social button images
	and JavaScript. The Google+ JavaScript is different for (what Google
	considers) invalid user agents. Since crawlers and robots might
	refresh the cached files, the NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT defines a default
	user agent string. You may define a NGFB_CURL_USERAGENT constant in
	your wp-config.php file to change the default NGFB uses.

NGFB_CURL_CAINFO

	When the "Verify SSL Certificates" option is checked, PHP's curl
	function needs a certificate authority file. Define the
	NGFB_CURL_CAINFO constant in your wp-config.php file to change the
	default location used by NGFB.
